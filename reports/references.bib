  abstract = {Metabarcoding has become a common approach to the rapid identification of the species composition in a mixed sample. The majority of studies use established short-read high-throughput sequencing platforms. The Oxford Nanopore MinIONTM, a portable sequencing platform, represents a low-cost alternative allowing researchers to generate sequence data in the field. However, a major drawback is the high raw read error rate that can range from 10\% to 22\%. To test whether the MinIONTM represents a viable alternative to other sequencing platforms, we used rolling circle amplification (RCA) to generate full-length consensus DNA barcodes for a bulk mock sample of 50 aquatic invertebrate species with at least 15\% genetic distance to each other. By applying two different laboratory protocols, we generated two MinIONTM runs that were used to build error-corrected consensus sequences. A newly developed Python pipeline, ASHURE, was used for data processing, consensus building, clustering and taxonomic assignment of the resulting reads. Our pipeline achieved median accuracies of up to 99.3\% for long concatemeric reads ({$>$}45 barcodes) and successfully identified all 50 species in the mock community. The use of RCA was integral for increasing consensus accuracy but was also the most time-consuming step of the laboratory workflow. Most concatemeric reads were skewed towards a shorter read length range with a median read length of up to 1,262 bp. Our study demonstrates that Nanopore sequencing can be used for metabarcoding, but exploration of other isothermal amplification procedures to improve consensus accuracy is recommended.},

  abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to a ubiquity of molecular sequence data. This data avalanche is particularly challenging in metagenetics, which focuses on taxonomic identification of sequences obtained from diverse microbial environments. Phylogenetic placement methods determine how these sequences fit into an evolutionary context. Previous implementations of phylogenetic placement algorithms, such as the evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA) included in RAxML, or PPLACER, are being increasingly used for this purpose. However, due to the steady progress in NGS technologies, the current implementations face substantial scalability limitations. Herein, we present EPA-NG, a complete reimplementation of the EPA that is substantially faster, offers a distributed memory parallelization, and integrates concepts from both, RAxML-EPA and PPLACER. EPA-NG can be executed on standard shared memory, as well as on distributed memory systems (e.g., computing clusters). To demonstrate the scalability of EPA-NG, we placed 1 billion metagenetic reads from the Tara Oceans Project onto a reference tree with 3748 taxa in just under 7 h, using 2048 cores. Our performance assessment shows that EPA-NG outperforms RAxML-EPA and PPLACER by up to a factor of 30 in sequential execution mode, while attaining comparable parallel efficiency on shared memory systems. We further show that the distributed memory parallelization of EPA-NG scales well up to 2048 cores. EPA-NG is available under the AGPLv3 license: https://github.com/Pbdas/epa-ng.},

Especially the next generation sequencing technologies can be expected to have a tremendous effect on fungal biodiversity and ecology research. In order to realise the full potential of these exciting techniques by accelerating biodiversity assessments, identification procedures of fungi need to be adapted to the emerging demands of modern large-scale ecological studies. But how should fungal species be identified in the near future? While the answer might seem trivial to most microbiologists, taxonomists working with fungi may have other views. In the present review, we will analyse the state of the art of the so-called barcoding initiatives in the light of fungi, and we will seek to evaluate emerging trends in the field. We will furthermore demonstrate that the usability of DNA barcoding as a major tool for identification of fungi largely depends on the development of high-quality sequence databases that are thoroughly curated by taxonomists and systematists. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {Summary: The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region is the primary choice for molecular identification of fungi. Its two highly variable spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) are usually species specific, whereas the intercalary 5.8S gene is highly conserved. For sequence clustering and blast searches, it is often advantageous to rely on either one of the variable spacers but not the conserved 5.8S gene. To identify and extract ITS1 and ITS2 from large taxonomic and environmental data sets is, however, often difficult, and many ITS sequences are incorrectly delimited in the public sequence databases. We introduce ITSx, a Perl-based software tool to extract ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 - as well as full-length ITS sequences - from both Sanger and high-throughput sequencing data sets. ITSx uses hidden Markov models computed from large alignments of a total of 20 groups of eukaryotes, including fungi, metazoans and plants, and the sequence extraction is based on the predicted positions of the ribosomal genes in the sequences. ITSx has a very high proportion of true-positive extractions and a low proportion of false-positive extractions. Additionally, process parallelization permits expedient analyses of very large data sets, such as a one million sequence amplicon pyrosequencing data set. ITSx is rich in features and written to be easily incorporated into automated sequence analysis pipelines. ITSx paves the way for more sensitive blast searches and sequence clustering operations for the ITS region in eukaryotes. The software also permits elimination of non-ITS sequences from any data set. This is particularly useful for amplicon-based next-generation sequencing data sets, where insidious non-target sequences are often found among the target sequences. Such non-target sequences are difficult to find by other means and would contribute noise to diversity estimates if left in the data set. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

  abstract = {Competition for resources between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) plants can alter belowground mycorrhizal communities, but few studies have investigated host effects on both AM and ECM communities. In Central Mexico, the AM plant Juniperus deppeana is frequently used for reforesting areas affected by soil erosion, while the surrounding native forests are dominated by ECM oak trees. Oaks are capable of associating with both AM and ECM fungi during part of their life cycle (a feature known as dual mycorrhization) but it is unclear whether junipers possess such ability. To assess how juniper planting may affect belowground fungal interactions with oaks, we investigated mycorrhizal associations in J. deppeana and Quercus rugosa seedlings along a disturbance gradient: a native oak forest, a mixed Juniperus-Quercus population in secondary vegetation and a juniper site severely degraded by mining extraction. We measured root colonization and identified fungal communities using soil and root meta-barcoding of the ITS2 rDNA region. ECM fungal community composition was strongly affected by disturbance (regardless of host), while the community composition of AM fungi was mostly host-dependent, with a higher AM fungal richness in J. deppeana. Importantly, the fungal communities associated with Q. rugosa seedlings significantly changed in the vicinity of juniper trees, while those of J. deppeana seedlings were not affected by the presence of oak trees. Even though ECM fungal richness was higher in Q. rugosa and in the native forest, we detected a variety of ECM fungi associated exclusively with J. deppeana seedlings, suggesting that this plant species may be colonized by ECM fungi. Our results indicate that J. deppeana can alter ECM native fungal communities, with implications for its use in reforestation of mixed oak forests.},

  abstract = {Background: Microbial inhabitants of soils are important to ecosystem and planetary functions, yet there are large gaps in our knowledge of their diversity and ecology. The 'Biomes of Australian Soil Environments' (BASE) project has generated a database of microbial diversity with associated metadata across extensive environmental gradients at continental scale. As the characterisation of microbes rapidly expands, the BASE database provides an evolving platform for interrogating and integrating microbial diversity and function. Findings: BASE currently provides amplicon sequences and associated contextual data for over 900 sites encompassing all Australian states and territories, a wide variety of bioregions, vegetation and land-use types. Amplicons target bacteria, archaea and general and fungal-specific eukaryotes. The growing database will soon include metagenomics data. Data are provided in both raw sequence (FASTQ) and analysed OTU table formats and are accessed via the project's data portal, which provides a user-friendly search tool to quickly identify samples of interest. Processed data can be visually interrogated and intersected with other Australian diversity and environmental data using tools developed by the 'Atlas of Living Australia'. Conclusions: Developed within an open data framework, the BASE project is the first Australian soil microbial diversity database. The database will grow and link to other global efforts to explore microbial, plant, animal, and marine biodiversity. Its design and open access nature ensures that BASE will evolve as a valuable tool for documenting an often overlooked component of biodiversity and the many microbe-driven processes that are essential to sustain soil function and ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {The scale of diversity of life on this planet is a significant challenge for any scientific programme hoping to produce a complete catalogue, whatever means is used. For DNA barcoding studies, this difficulty is compounded by the realization that any chosen barcode sequence is not the gene 'for' speciation and that taxa have evolutionary histories. How are we to disentangle the confounding effects of reticulate population genetic processes? Using the DNA barcode data from meiofaunal surveys, here we discuss the benefits of treating the taxa defined by barcodes without reference to their correspondence to 'species', and suggest that using this non-idealist approach facilitates access to taxon groups that are not accessible to other methods of enumeration and classification. Major issues remain, in particular the methodologies for taxon discrimination in DNA barcode data. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. Results: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.

Capitalizing on the recent explosion of crowdsourcing data, we undertook a global reassessment, more exhaustive and reproducible than the 2011 effort, to highlight new knowledge obtained from improved data integration and to assess changes in distribution of alien wattles over the past decade. We gathered data from 105 sources to assemble a global database listing species introductions and naturalizations at the country level; and make this available online to facilitate future reassessments. We explore patterns of introduction and naturalization and modelled the relationships between naturalizations of wattles, macroclimate, sampling effort, and various variables of introduction pressures across countries. Wattles have been introduced to 172 countries. However, only 28\% of the 959 introduction events have (until now) led to naturalization, and even fewer species naturalized in the five countries that received most introductions (between 9 and 27\%). We found evidence of 417 Acacia species (41\% of species in the genus) introduced outside Australia so far; this adds 31 species to the 2011 assessment. At least 75 species have become naturalized. Two-thirds of reported introduction events only involved the 30 most widely exported species. Only 22\% of the species ever exported have been reported over the past 70 years outside Australia, of which 20\% have naturalized. Naturalization richness was well explained by our model, which showed the number of uses of introduced species to be a strong determinant of naturalization success. Our results provide insights into the consequences of the ongoing momentum of the human-mediated dissemination of wattles. They show that most wattle introductions have not (yet) resulted in naturalization, but that species that are intensively planted during their introduction, notably those used in forestry, often naturalize. We discuss how recent trends point to a globalization of wattle transfers, especially of forestry species, and suggest that many more naturalizations lie ahead.

These organelles contain their own genetic system, a remnant of the endosymbiont's genome, which encodes only a fraction of the mitochondrial proteome. The majority of mitochondrial proteins are translated from nuclear genes and are imported into mitochondria. Recent studies of phylogenetically diverse representatives of Fungi reveal that their mitochondrial DNAs are among the most highly derived, encoding only a limited set of genes. Much of the reduction in the coding content of the mitochondrial genome probably occurred early in fungal evolution. Nevertheless, genome reduction is an ongoing process. Fungi in the chytridiomycete order Neocallimastigales and in the pathogenic Microsporidia have taken mitochondrial reduction to the extreme and have permanently lost a mitochondrial genome. These organisms have organelles derived from mitochondria that retain traces of their mitochondrial ancestry. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Approximately 625 fungal species have been reported to infect vertebrates, 200 of which can be human associated, either as commensals and members of our microbiome or as pathogens that cause infectious diseases. These organisms pose a growing threat to human health with the global increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections, prevalence of fungal allergy, and the evolution of fungal pathogens resistant to some or all current classes of antifungals. More broadly, there has been an unprecedented and worldwide emergence of fungal pathogens affecting animal and plant biodiversity. Approximately 8,000 species of fungi and Oomycetes are associated with plant disease. Indeed, across agriculture, such fungal diseases of plants include new devastating epidemics of trees and jeopardize food security worldwide by causing epidemics in staple and commodity crops that feed billions. Further, ingestion of mycotoxins contributes to ill health and causes cancer. Coordinated international research efforts, enhanced technology translation, and greater policy outreach by scientists are needed to more fully understand the biology and drivers that underlie the emergence of fungal diseases and to mitigate against their impacts. Here, we focus on poignant examples of emerging fungal threats in each of three areas: human health, wildlife biodiversity, and food security.}

New methods control errors sufficiently such that amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be resolved exactly, down to the level of single-nucleotide differences over the sequenced gene region. The benefits of finer resolution are immediately apparent, and arguments for ASV methods have focused on their improved resolution. Less obvious, but we believe more important, are the broad benefits that derive from the status of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological meaning identified independently from a reference database. Here we discuss how these features grant ASVs the combined advantages of closed-reference OTUs - including computational costs that scale linearly with study size, simple merging between independently processed data sets, and forward prediction - and of de novo OTUs - including accurate measurement of diversity and applicability to communities lacking deep coverage in reference databases. We argue that the improvements in reusability, reproducibility and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great that ASVs should replace OTUs as the standard unit of marker-gene analysis and reporting.},

While Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) outperforms exact methods through its use of heuristics, the speed of the current BLAST software is suboptimal for very long queries or database sequences. There are also some shortcomings in the user-interface of the current command-line applications.Results: We describe features and improvements of rewritten BLAST software and introduce new command-line applications. Long query sequences are broken into chunks for processing, in some cases leading to dramatically shorter run times. For long database sequences, it is possible to retrieve only the relevant parts of the sequence, reducing CPU time and memory usage for searches of short queries against databases of contigs or chromosomes. The program can now retrieve masking information for database sequences from the BLAST databases. A new modular software library can now access subject sequence data from arbitrary data sources. We introduce several new features, including strategy files that allow a user to save and reuse their favorite set of options. The strategy files can be uploaded to and downloaded from the NCBI BLAST web site.Conclusion: The new BLAST command-line applications, compared to the current BLAST tools, demonstrate substantial speed improvements for long queries as well as chromosome length database sequences. We have also improved the user interface of the command-line applications. © 2009 Camacho et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Amplicon sequencing has revolutionized our ability to study DNA collected from environmental samples by providing a rapid and sensitive technique for microbial community analysis that eliminates the challenges associated with lab cultivation and taxonomic identification through microscopy. In water resources management, it can be especially useful to evaluate ecosystem shifts in response to natural and anthropogenic landscape disturbances to signal potential water quality concerns, such as the detection of toxic cyanobacteria or pathogenic bacteria. Amplicon sequencing data consist of discrete counts of sequence reads, the sum of which is the library size. Groups of samples typically have different library sizes that are not representative of biological variation; library size normalization is required to meaningfully compare diversity between them. Rarefaction is a widely used normalization technique that involves the random subsampling of sequences from the initial sample library to a selected normalized library size. Rarefying is often dismissed as statistically invalid because subsampling effectively discards a portion of the observed sequences. Nonetheless, it remains prevalent in practice. Notably, the superiority of rarefying relative to many other normalization approaches has been argued in diversity analysis. Here, repeated rarefying is proposed as a tool for diversity analyses to normalize library sizes. This enables (i) proportionate representation of all observed sequences and (ii) characterization of the random variation introduced to diversity analyses by rarefying to a smaller library size shared by all samples. While many deterministic data transformations are not tailored to produce equal library sizes, repeatedly rarefying reflects the probabilistic process by which amplicon sequencing data are obtained as a representation of the source microbial community. Specifically, it evaluates which data might have been obtained if a particular sample’s library size had been smaller and allows graphical representation of the effects of this library size normalization process upon diversity analysis results.},

  abstract = {Metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) and DNA extracted from bulk specimen samples is a powerful tool in studies of biodiversity, diet and ecological interactions as its inherent labelling of amplicons allows sequencing of taxonomically informative genetic markers from many samples in parallel. However, the occurrence of so-called ‘tag-jumps' can cause incorrect assignment of sequences to samples and artificially inflate diversity. Two steps during library preparation of pools of 5ʹ nucleotide-tagged amplicons have been suggested to cause tag-jumps: (a) T4 DNA polymerase blunt-ending in the end-repair step and (b) postligation PCR amplification of amplicon libraries. The discovery of tag-jumps has led to recommendations to only carry out metabarcoding PCR amplifications with primers carrying twin-tags to ensure that tag-jumps cannot result in false assignments of sequences to samples. As this increases both cost and workload, a metabarcoding library preparation protocol which circumvents the two steps that causes tag-jumps is needed. Here, we demonstrate Tagsteady, a PCR-free metabarcoding Illumina library preparation protocol for pools of nucleotide-tagged amplicons that enables efficient and cost-effective generation of metabarcoding data with virtually no tag-jumps. We use pools of twin-tagged amplicons to investigate the effect of T4 DNA polymerase blunt-ending and postligation PCR on the occurrence of tag-jumps and demonstrate that both blunt-ending and postligation PCR, alone or together, can result in detrimental amounts of tag-jumps (here, up to ca. 49\% of total sequences), while leaving both steps out (the Tagsteady protocol) results in amounts of sequences carrying new combinations of used tags (tag-jumps) comparable to background contamination.},

  abstract = {Full taxonomic characterisation of fungal communities is necessary for establishing ecological associations and early detection of pathogens and invasive species. Complex communities of fungi are regularly characterised by metabarcoding using the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and the Large-Subunit (LSU) gene of the rRNA locus, but reliance on a single short sequence fragment limits the confidence of identification. Here we link metabarcoding from the ITS2 and LSU D1-D2 regions to characterise fungal communities associated with bark beetles (Scolytinae), the likely vectors of several tree pathogens. Both markers revealed similar patterns of overall species richness and response to key variables (beetle species, forest type), but identification against the respective reference databases using various taxonomic classifiers revealed poor resolution towards lower taxonomic levels, especially the species level. Thus, Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) could not be linked via taxonomic classifiers across ITS and LSU fragments. However, using phylogenetic trees (focused on the epidemiologically important Sordariomycetes) we placed OTUs obtained with either marker relative to reference sequences of the entire rRNA cistron that includes both loci and demonstrated the largely similar phylogenetic distribution of ITS and LSU-derived OTUs. Sensitivity analysis of congruence in both markers suggested the biologically most defensible threshold values for OTU delimitation in Sordariomycetes to be 98\% for ITS2 and 99\% for LSU D1-D2. Studies of fungal communities using the canonical ITS barcode require corroboration across additional loci. Phylogenetic analysis of OTU sequences aligned to the full rRNA cistron shows higher success rate and greater accuracy of species identification compared to probabilistic taxonomic classifiers.},

However, little is known about the response of mycelial biomass to disturbances, and how fungi reallocate carbon into different fungal structures under environmental stressors. We investigated above- and below-ground fungal biomass shifts in response to different intensities of forest management in Mediterranean Pinus pinaster forests. Soil fungal biomass was estimated by ergosterol quantification and production of sporocarps was estimated from repeated field samplings during 5 years in 26 experimental plots. Abundance of mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi belowground was determined using Pacific Biosciences sequencing of fungal ITS2 amplicons. Thinning had a prolonged negative effect belowground, inter- and intra-annually, on total fungal biomass and on the biomass of ectomycorrhizal fungi, but not on saprotrophic fungi. Total and ectomycorrhizal mushroom yields were negatively correlated with the total and the ectomycorrhizal mycelial biomass, respectively. Thinning also correlated positively with the aboveground/belowground ratio of both total and ectomycorrhizal fungal biomass. We show potential short-term shifts in resource allocation of fungi from below-to above-ground structures under disturbances such as forest thinning. Ectomycorrhizal fungi may respond to disturbances by increasing reproduction rather than colonizing the surrounding soil.},

We used Illumina sequencing to document fungi on the roots of Oreomunnea mexicana in Panama and Mexico and Alfaropsis roxburghiana in China. Ectomycorrhizal fungi dominated the communities with both hosts but we detected a more diverse root-associated fungal community in Alfaropsis but higher ectomycorrhizal fungi richness in Oreomunnea. Geographic distance was the best predictor of variation in fungal species composition, when including both hosts and when analyzing each host independently. However, our results showed a high correlation between geographic distance and abiotic variables, and therefore we were not able to determine if the observed changes in fungal community composition were explained also by spatially structured environmental or phylogenetic factors.},

We demonstrate that the highest numbers of successfully sequenced samples were achieved with the ONT R10 \& Q20+ chemistry combination. In terms of library preparation time, ONT protocols were the quickest. Compared to Sanger sequencing, we estimate that third-generation platforms become more cost-effective when a study requires the barcoding of more than 61 (Flongle), 183 (MinION), or 356 (PacBio) samples. Although both tested platforms are suitable for DNA barcoding, both had limitations, and applicability to different studies. The pipeline we have developed, which goes from whole specimens to final DNA barcode sequences, can aid planning and budgeting for biodiversity studies, maximising the number of specimens sequenced in one run and speeding up sample processing time.},

By employing carefully crafted recurrent neural networks, our tool significantly improves base calling accuracy on data from R7.3 version of the platform compared to the default base caller supplied by the manufacturer. On R9 version, we achieve results comparable to Nanonet base caller provided by Oxford Nanopore.

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; Glomeromycota) are difficult to culture; therefore, establishing a robust amplicon-based approach to taxa identification is imperative to describe AMF diversity. Further, due to low and biased sampling of AMF taxa, molecular databases do not represent the breadth of AMF diversity, making database matching approaches suboptimal. Therefore, a full description of AMF diversity requires a tool to determine sequence-based placement in the Glomeromycota clade. Nonetheless, commonly used gene regions, including the SSU and ITS, do not enable reliable phylogenetic placement. Here, we present an improved database and pipeline for the phylogenetic determination of AMF using amplicons from the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene. We improve our database and backbone tree by including additional outgroup sequences. We also improve an existing bioinformatics pipeline by aligning forward and reverse reads separately, using a universal alignment for all tree building, and implementing a BLAST screening prior to tree building to remove non-homologous sequences. Finally, we present a script to extract AMF belonging to 11 major families as well as an amplicon sequencing variant (ASV) version of our pipeline. We test the utility of the pipeline by testing the placement of known AMF, known non-AMF, and Acaulospora sp. spore sequences. This work represents the most comprehensive database and pipeline for phylogenetic placement of AMF LSU amplicon sequences within the Glomeromycota clade.},

  abstract = {Deoxyribonucleic acid ( ; DNA) is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix. The polymer carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids. Alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phosphodiester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, the single-ringed pyrimidines and the double-ringed purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine. Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information. This information is replicated when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98\% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (or bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription, where DNA bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine (T), for which RNA substitutes uracil (U). Under the genetic code, these RNA strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation. Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. Before typical cell division, these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus as nuclear DNA, and some in the mitochondria as mitochondrial DNA or in chloroplasts as chloroplast DNA. In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm, in circular chromosomes. Within eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins, such as histones, compact and organize DNA. These compacting structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.},

  abstract = {We examined the species diversity of an ectomycorrhizal community in natural stands of bishop pine (Pinus muricata D. Don) to determine the correspondence between above- and below-ground views of species composition, spatial frequency, and abundance. We addressed this question by simultaneously sampling fruit bodies and ectomycorrhizae over a 4-year period. By using molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction, we were able to identify the fungal symbionts directly from mycorrhizae in nearly all of the mycorrhizal morphotypes we found. Most species were either rare or low in abundance. Among the common species we observed three patterns: (i) some species, such as Russula xerampelina s.l. and Amanita francheti were well represented both above- and below-ground; (ii) some common fruiting species such as Suillus pungens were rare components belowground; (iii) some species that were common as mycorrhizae were represented poorly or unrepresented in the aboveground fruiting record. The latter was the case for Russula amoenolens, thelephoroid types (i.e., Tomentella sublilacina and thelephoroid-2), and a boletoid type. These results show that (i) the pattern of resource allocation to production of fruit bodies versus ectomycorrhizae varied among species, and (ii) the correspondence between above- and below-ground is imprecise at best at the community level.

Undetected chimeras may be misinterpreted as novel species, causing inflated estimates of diversity and spurious inferences of differences between populations. Detection and removal of chimeras is therefore of critical importance in such experiments. Results: We describe UCHIME, a new program that detects chimeric sequences with two or more segments. UCHIME either uses a database of chimera-free sequences or detects chimeras de novo by exploiting abundance data. UCHIME has better sensitivity than ChimeraSlayer (previously the most sensitive database method), especially with short, noisy sequences. In testing on artificial bacterial communities with known composition, UCHIME de novo sensitivity is shown to be comparable to Perseus. UCHIME is {$>$}100× faster than Perseus and {$>$}1000× faster than ChimeraSlayer. © The Author(s) 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.},

  abstract = {Background The increased usage of error-prone long-read sequencing for metabarcoding of fungi has not been matched with adequate public databases and concomitant analysis approaches. We address this gap and present a proof-of-concept study for classifying fungal taxa using linked machine learning classifiers. We demonstrate the capability of linked machine learning classifiers to accurately classify species and strains using real-world and simulated fungal ribosomal DNA datasets, including plant and human pathogens. We benchmark our new approach in comparison to current alignment and k-mer based methods based on synthetic mock communities. We also assess real world applications of species identification in complex unlabelled datasets. Results Our machine learning approach assigned individual nanopore long-read amplicon sequences to fungal species with high recall rates and low false positive rates. Importantly, our approach successfully distinguished between closely-related species and strains when individual read errors were higher than the genetic distance between individual taxa, which the alignment and k-mer methods could not do. The machine learning approach showed an ability to identify key species with high recall rates, even in complex samples of unknown species composition. Conclusions A proof of concept machine learning approach using a tree-descent approach on a decision tree of classifiers can identify known taxa with high accuracy, and precisely detect known target species from complex samples with high recall rates. We propose this approach is suitable for detecting the known knowns of pathogens or invasive species in any environment of mostly unknown composition, including agriculture and wild ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Long amplicon metabarcoding has opened the door for phylogenetic analysis of the largely unknown communities of microeukaryotes in soil. Here, we amplified and sequenced the ITS and LSU regions of the rDNA operon (around 1500 bp) from grassland soils using PacBio SMRT sequencing. We tested how three different methods for generation of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) effected estimated richness and identified taxa, and how well large-scale ecological patterns associated with shifting environmental conditions were recovered in data from the three methods. The field site at Kungsängen Nature Reserve has drawn frequent visitors since Linnaeus's time, and its species rich vegetation includes the largest population of Fritillaria meleagris in Sweden. To test the effect of different OTU generation methods, we sampled soils across an abrupt moisture transition that divides the meadow community into a Carex acuta dominated plant community with low species richness in the wetter part, which is visually distinct from the mesic-dry part that has a species rich grass-dominated plant community including a high frequency of F. meleagris. We used the moisture and plant community transition as a framework to investigate how detected belowground microeukaryotic community composition was influenced by OTU generation methods. Soil communities in both moisture regimes were dominated by protists, a large fraction of which were taxonomically assigned to Ciliophora (Alveolata) while 30\%–40\% of all reads were assigned to kingdom Fungi. Ecological patterns were consistently recovered irrespective of OTU generation method used. However, different methods strongly affect richness estimates and the taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution of the characterized community with implications for how well members of the microeukaryotic communities can be recognized in the data.},

  abstract = {Background: Fungi play critical roles in many ecosystems, cause serious diseases in plants and animals, and pose significant threats to human health and structural integrity problems in built environments. While most fungal diversity remains unknown, the development of PCR primers for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) combined with next-generation sequencing has substantially improved our ability to profile fungal microbial diversity. Although the high sequence variability in the ITS region facilitates more accurate species identification, it also makes multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis unreliable across evolutionarily distant fungi because the sequences are hard to align accurately. To address this issue, we created ghost-tree, a bioinformatics tool that integrates sequence data from two genetic markers into a single phylogenetic tree that can be used for diversity analyses. Our approach starts with a "foundation" phylogeny based on one genetic marker whose sequences can be aligned across organisms spanning divergent taxonomic groups (e.g., fungal families). Then, "extension" phylogenies are built for more closely related organisms (e.g., fungal species or strains) using a second more rapidly evolving genetic marker. These smaller phylogenies are then grafted onto the foundation tree by mapping taxonomic names such that each corresponding foundation-tree tip would branch into its new "extension tree" child. Results: We applied ghost-tree to graft fungal extension phylogenies derived from ITS sequences onto a foundation phylogeny derived from fungal 18S sequences. Our analysis of simulated and real fungal ITS data sets found that phylogenetic distances between fungal communities computed using ghost-tree phylogenies explained significantly more variance than non-phylogenetic distances. The phylogenetic metrics also improved our ability to distinguish small differences (effect sizes) between microbial communities, though results were similar to non-phylogenetic methods for larger effect sizes. Conclusions: The Silva/UNITE-based ghost tree presented here can be easily integrated into existing fungal analysis pipelines to enhance the resolution of fungal community differences and improve understanding of these communities in built environments. The ghost-tree software package can also be used to develop phylogenetic trees for other marker gene sets that afford different taxonomic resolution, or for bridging genome trees with amplicon trees.},

Their hyphae provide an efficient mechanism for distributing plant carbon throughout the soil, facilitating its deposition into soil pores and onto mineral surfaces, where it can be protected from microbial attack. Mycorrhizal exudates and dead tissues contribute to the microbial necromass pool now known to play a dominant role in SOM formation and stabilization. While mycorrhizal fungi lack the genetic capacity to act as saprotrophs, they use several strategies to access nutrients locked in SOM and thereby promote its decay, including direct enzymatic breakdown, oxidation via Fenton chemistry, and stimulation of heterotrophic microorganisms through carbon provision to the rhizosphere. An additional mechanism, competition with free-living saprotrophs, potentially suppresses SOM decomposition, leading to its accumulation. How these various nutrient acquisition strategies differentially influence SOM formation, stabilization, and loss is an area of critical research need.},

There is increasing awareness that microbiome datasets generated by HTS are compositional because they have an arbitrary total imposed by the instrument. However, many investigators are either unaware of this or assume specific properties of the compositional data. The purpose of this review is to alert investigators to the dangers inherent in ignoring the compositional nature of the data, and point out that HTS datasets derived from microbiome studies can and should be treated as compositions at all stages of analysis. We briefly introduce compositional data, illustrate the pathologies that occur when compositional data are analyzed inappropriately, and finally give guidance and point to resources and examples for the analysis of microbiome datasets using compositional data analysis.},

  abstract = {Across a global range of temperate to tropical environments, Australian species of Acacia (‘wattles’) provide a highly diverse range of economic benefits. These include both production of internationally tradable commodities and benefits that are primarily local. Trends over the past decade are discussed with comment on likely future prospects. By far the largest wattle plantation areas are in South-East Asia, with A. mangium, its hybrid with A. auriculiformis, and A. crassicarpa being the predominant taxa. Over 3.5 Mha support production of kraft pulp worth around US\$7 billion per annum in addition to solid wood products worth over US\$6 billion per annum. There is scope for further expansion, particularly in Vietnam. Elsewhere, the most significant industry is tannin production from A. mearnsii in Brazil and South Africa. This is a mature industry with demand static or somewhat in decline. Acacia dealbata flowers are processed to produce mimosa oil, which has long been used by perfume manufacturers in southern France. Demand is expanding and is increasingly met from lower-cost regions including India. The ornamental value of winter-flowering wattles was the primary driver of introductions to Mediterranean countries, and horticultural use and associated cut-flower production are still important, as they are in Australia. Rural communities in many countries derive domestic fuelwood and poles from planted wattles and this demand is likely to persist. Across Australia, in line with commitments to halt loss of biodiversity and mitigate climate change, wattles are an important component of environmental restoration and carbon farming projects, where they are well suited to low-cost establishment by direct seeding. Recent patterns of seed export from the CSIRO Australian Tree Seed Centre are reviewed as an indication of changing demand for wood-producing taxa. Many additional species are used in horticulture and environmental restoration projects, contributing further diversity to the range of useful species.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing platforms are increasingly being used for targeted amplicon sequencing because they enable cost-effective sequencing of large sample sets. For meaningful interpretation of targeted amplicon sequencing data and comparison between studies, it is critical that bioinformatic analyses do not introduce artefacts and rely on detailed protocols to ensure that all methods are properly performed and documented. The analysis of large sample sets and the use of predefined indexes create challenges, such as adjusting the sequencing depth across samples and taking sequencing errors or index hopping into account. However, the potential biases these factors introduce to high-throughput amplicon sequencing data sets and how they may be overcome have rarely been addressed. On the example of a nested metabarcoding analysis of 1920 carabid beetle regurgitates to assess plant feeding, we investigated: (i) the variation in sequencing depth of individually tagged samples and the effect of library preparation on the data output; (ii) the influence of sequencing errors within index regions and its consequences for demultiplexing; and (iii) the effect of index hopping. Our results demonstrate that despite library quantification, large variation in read counts and sequencing depth occurred among samples and that the sequencing error rate in bioinformatic software is essential for accurate adapter/primer trimming and demultiplexing. Moreover, setting an index hopping threshold to avoid incorrect assignment of samples is highly recommended.},

  abstract = {Bacterial diversity among environmental samples is commonly assessed with PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene (16S) sequences. Perceived diversity, however, can be influenced by sample preparation, primer selection, and formation of chimeric 16S amplification products. Chimeras are hybrid products between multiple parent sequences that can be falsely interpreted as novel organisms, thus inflating apparent diversity. We developed a new chimera detection tool called Chimera Slayer (CS). CS detects chimeras with greater sensitivity than previous methods, performs well on short sequences such as those produced by the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) Genome Sequencer, and can scale to large data sets. By benchmarking CS performance against sequences derived from a controlled DNA mixture of known organisms and a simulated chimera set, we provide insights into the factors that affect chimera formation such as sequence abundance, the extent of similarity between 16S genes, and PCR conditions. Chimeras were found to reproducibly form among independent amplifications and contributed to false perceptions of sample diversity and the false identification of novel taxa, with less-abundant species exhibiting chimera rates exceeding 70\%. Shotgun metagenomic sequences of our mock community appear to be devoid of 16S chimeras, supporting a role for shotgun metagenomics in validating novel organisms discovered in targeted sequence surveys. © 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

  abstract = {Timely and accurate biodiversity analysis poses an ongoing challenge for the success of biomonitoring programs. Morphology-based identification of bioindicator taxa is time consuming, and rarely supports species-level resolution especially for immature life stages. Much work has been done in the past decade to develop alternative approaches for biodiversity analysis using DNA sequence-based approaches such as molecular phylogenetics and DNA barcoding. On-going assembly of DNA barcode reference libraries will provide the basis for a DNA-based identification system. The use of recently introduced next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches in biodiversity science has the potential to further extend the application of DNA information for routine biomonitoring applications to an unprecedented scale. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using 454 massively parallel pyrosequencing for species-level analysis of freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate taxa commonly used for biomonitoring. We designed our experiments in order to directly compare morphology-based, Sanger sequencing DNA barcoding, and next-generation environmental barcoding approaches. Our results show the ability of 454 pyrosequencing of mini-barcodes to accurately identify all species with more than 1\% abundance in the pooled mixture. Although the approach failed to identify 6 rare species in the mixture, the presence of sequences from 9 species that were not represented by individuals in the mixture provides evidence that DNA based analysis may yet provide a valuable approach in finding rare species in bulk environmental samples. We further demonstrate the application of the environmental barcoding approach by comparing benthic macroinvertebrates from an urban region to those obtained from a conservation area. Although considerable effort will be required to robustly optimize NGS tools to identify species from bulk environmental samples, our results indicate the potential of an environmental barcoding approach for biomonitoring programs.}

Various sets of universal and taxon-specific primers have been developed, extending the usability of metabarcoding across archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. Accordingly, a multitude of metabarcoding data analysis tools and pipelines have also been developed. Often, several developed workflows are designed to process the same amplicon sequencing data, making it somewhat puzzling to choose one among the plethora of existing pipelines. However, each pipeline has its own specific philosophy, strengths and limitations, which should be considered depending on the aims of any specific study, as well as the bioinformatics expertise of the user. In this review, we outline the input data requirements, supported operating systems and particular attributes of thirty-two amplicon processing pipelines with the goal of helping users to select a pipeline for their metabarcoding projects.},

Notwithstanding that fungi are not actually part of the plant kingdom, how right he has proved to be as the bicentenary of his prediction approaches. By the 1960s a few mycologists were speculating that there might be as many fungal as plant species, but almost no attempts to calculate estimates from the available data were made. As concern over the conservation of biodiversity in general grew in the subsequent decades, culminating in the signing of the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992, more precise figures on species numbers of all kinds of organisms were required. A series of estimates of the number of fungi settled on figures ranging from 500,000 to almost 10 million species, with 1.5 to perhaps 5 million receiving most support among mycologists. A recent study even predicts up to a trillion species of microorganisms globally (1); how many of these are supposed to be fungi is not specified, but if this estimate holds true and only 1\% of these were fungi, the global estimate of fungal diversity would be a thousand times higher than the current highest estimate of 10 million species.},

We are convinced that the sole prospect for a sustainable identification capability lies in the construction of systems that employ DNA sequences as taxon 'barcodes'. We establish that the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) can serve as the core of a global bioidentification system for animals. First, we demonstrate that COI profiles, derived from the low-density sampling of higher taxonomic categories, ordinarily assign newly analysed taxa to the appropriate phylum or order. Second, we demonstrate that species-level assignments can be obtained by creating comprehensive COI profiles. A model COI profile, based upon the analysis of a single individual from each of 200 closely allied species of lepidopterans, was 100\% successful in correctly identifying subsequent specimens. When fully developed, a COI identification system will provide a reliable, cost-effective and accessible solution to the current problem of species identification. Its assembly will also generate important new insights into the diversification of life and the rules of molecular evolution.},

Location Global. Taxon Acacia dealbata, Fabaceae. Methods Our dataset comprised 1615 samples representing 92 populations sampled in the species’ native and non-native ranges. We employed a combination of genetic fingerprinting (microsatellite markers) and genetic modelling approaches. We calculated genetic diversity for each population and tested for genetic isolation by distance within each range. A combination of Bayesian assignment tests and multivariate ordination was applied to identify genetic structure among populations. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) analyses were conducted to test different competing introduction scenarios for each non-native range. Results The majority of the species’ non-native ranges was characterized by high genetic diversity and low levels of genetic structure. With regard to introduction histories, however, our results supported different introduction scenarios for different non-native ranges. We did not find strong support for any of tested introduction scenarios for populations in Chile and Madagascar, but these likely originated from multiple introductions followed by admixture. Populations in New Zealand and La Réunion most likely originated directly from Tasmania, possibly through multiple introductions. Similar to previous findings for South African populations, no clear introduction history could be identified for populations in Portugal and the United States. Main conclusions Our study shows that global introductions of A. dealbata were complex and one scenario does not fit the invasion history of the species in different regions. We discuss how this complexity needs to be considered when formulating strategies for the effective management of the species. Future research needs to help bridge persisting knowledge gaps are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Microorganisms are not only indispensable to ecosystem functioning, they are also keystones for emerging technologies. In the last 15 years, the number of studies on environmental microbial communities has increased exponentially due to advances in sequencing technologies, but the large amount of data generated remains difficult to analyze and interpret. Recently, metabarcoding analysis has shifted from clustering reads using Operational Taxonomical Units (OTUs) to Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). Differences between these methods can seriously affect the biological interpretation of metabarcoding data, especially in ecosystems with high microbial diversity, as the methods are benchmarked based on low diversity datasets. Results: In this work we have thoroughly examined the differences in community diversity, structure, and complexity between the OTU and ASV methods. We have examined culture-based mock and simulated datasets as well as soil- and plant-associated bacterial and fungal environmental communities. Four key findings were revealed. First, analysis of microbial datasets at family level guaranteed both consistency and adequate coverage when using either method. Second, the performance of both methods used are related to community diversity and sample sequencing depth. Third, differences in the method used affected sample diversity and number of detected differentially abundant families upon treatment; this may lead researchers to draw different biological conclusions. Fourth, the observed differences can mostly be attributed to low abundant (relative abundance {$<$} 0.1\%) families, thus extra care is recommended when studying rare species using metabarcoding. The ASV method used outperformed the adopted OTU method concerning community diversity, especially for fungus-related sequences, but only when the sequencing depth was sufficient to capture the community complexity. Conclusions: Investigation of metabarcoding data should be done with care. Correct biological interpretation depends on several factors, including in-depth sequencing of the samples, choice of the most appropriate filtering strategy for the specific research goal, and use of family level for data clustering.},

The two land-use types contained communities that were distinct and more than 10\% of the molecular OTUs differed in their frequency.},

  abstract = {High throughput sequencing of PCR amplicons derived from environmental DNA (aka DNA metabarcoding) has become an integral part of fungal ecology, enabling in-depth characterization of fungal communities. In most cases, the rDNA Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region, which has a long history as a target in fungal systematics, is used as a DNA barcode marker. Despite improvements in sequencing techniques and bioinformatics approaches, there are inherent limitations associated with the use of a single-locus DNA marker that are often ignored. In this text, I discuss both inherent biological and methodological limitations associated with the use of the ITS marker. For example, proper species delimitation is often not possible with a single marker, and a significant DNA barcoding gap (i.e. interspecific divergence) is often missing between sister taxa in ITS. Further, we can rarely be fully confident about the assigned species-level taxonomy based on available reference sequences. In addition to the inherent limitations, an extra layer of complexity and variation is blended into DNA metabarcoding data due to PCR and sequencing errors that may look similar to natural molecular variation. The bioinformatics processing of ITS amplicons must take into account both the basic properties of the ITS region, as well as the generated errors and biases. In this regard, we cannot adopt approaches and settings from other markers, such as 16S and 18S, blindly. For example, due to intraspecific variability in the ITS region, and sometimes intragenomic variability, ITS sequences must be clustered to approach species level resolution in community studies. Therefore, I argue that the concept of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) is not applicable. Although the ITS region is by far the best option as a general DNA (meta)barcoding marker for fungi, this contribution is meant to remind against a naive or simplistic use of the ITS region, and for stimulating further discussions.}

  abstract = {PCR permits the exponential and sequence-specific amplification of DNA, even from minute starting quantities. PCR is a fundamental step in preparing DNA samples for high-throughput sequencing. However, there are errors associated with PCRmediated amplification. Here we examine the effects of four important sources of error-bias, stochasticity, template switches and polymerase errors-on sequence representation in low-input next-generation sequencing libraries. We designed a pool of diverse PCR amplicons with a defined structure, and then used Illumina sequencing to search for signatures of each process. We further developed quantitative models for each process, and compared predictions of these models to our experimental data. We find that PCR stochasticity is the major force skewing sequence representation after amplification of a pool of unique DNA amplicons. Polymerase errors become very common in later cycles of PCR but have little impact on the overall sequence distribution as they are confined to small copy numbers. PCR template switches are rare and confined to low copy numbers. Our results provide a theoretical basis for removing distortions from high-throughput sequencing data. In addition, our findings on PCR stochasticity will have particular relevance to quantification of results from single cell sequencing, in which sequences are represented by only one or a few molecules.},

  abstract = {Assessment of biodiversity using metabarcoding data, such as from bulk or environmental DNA sampling, is becoming increasingly relevant in ecology, biodiversity sciences and monitoring. Thereby, the taxonomic identification of species from their DNA sequences relies strongly on reference databases that link genetic sequences to taxonomic names. These databases vary in completeness and availability, depending on the taxonomic group studied and the genetic region targeted. The incompleteness of reference databases is an important argument to explain the nondetection by metabarcoding of species supposedly present. However, there exist further and generally overlooked problems with reference databases that can lead to false or inaccurate inferences of taxonomic assignment. Here, we synthesize all possible problems inherent to reference databases. In particular, we identify a complete, mutually nonexclusive list of seven classes of challenges when it comes to selecting, developing and using a reference database for taxonomic assignment. These are: (i) mislabelling, (ii) sequencing errors, (iii) sequence conflict, (iv) taxonomic conflict, (v) low taxonomic resolution, (vi) missing taxa and (vii) missing intraspecific variants. For each problem identified, we provide a description of possible consequences on the taxonomic assignment process. We illustrate the respective problem with examples taken from the literature or obtained by quantitative analyses of public databases, such as GenBank or BOLD. Finally, we discuss possible solutions to the identified problems and how to navigate them. Only by raising users' awareness of the limitations of metabarcoding data and DNA reference databases will adequate interpretations of these data be achieved.},

Microbes are of particular importance since they drive biogeochemical cycles, being both producers and decomposers. Their quick and direct responses to changes in environmental conditions modulate the ecosystem accordingly, thus providing a sensitive readout. Here we have used direct sequencing of total DNA from water samples to compare the microbial communities of two distinct coastal regions exposed to different anthropogenic pressures: the highly polluted Port of Genoa and the protected area of Montecristo Island in the Mediterranean Sea. Analysis of the metagenomes revealed significant differences in both microbial diversity and abundance between the two areas, reflecting their distinct ecological habitats and anthropogenic stress conditions. Our results indicate that the combination of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and bioinformatics tools presents a new approach to monitor the diversity and the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. Integration of metagenomics into environmental monitoring campaigns should enable the impact of the anthropogenic pressure on microbial biodiversity in various ecosystems to be better assessed and also predicted.}

Developments in phylogenetic and functional trait research bear great promise for better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Global patterns are emerging with propagule pressure, disturbance, increased resource availability, and climate matching as major invasion drivers, but species characteristics also play a role. Biotic interactions with resident communities shape invasion outcomes, with major roles for species diversity, enemies, novel weapons, and mutualists. Mounting evidence has been found for rapid evolution of invasive aliens and evolutionary responses of natives, but a mechanistic understanding requires tighter integration of molecular and phenotypic approaches.

  abstract = {Long-read single-molecule sequencing has revolutionized de novo genome assembly and enabled the automated reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. However, given the relatively high error rates of such technologies, efficient and accurate assembly of large repeats and closely related haplotypes remains challenging. We address these issues with Canu, a successor of Celera Assembler that is specifically designed for noisy single-molecule sequences. Canu introduces support for nanopore sequencing, halves depth-of-coverage requirements, and improves assembly continuity while simultaneously reducing runtime by an order of magnitude on large genomes versus Celera Assembler 8.2. These advances result from new overlapping and assembly algorithms, including an adaptive overlapping strategy based on tf-idf weighted MinHash and a sparse assembly graph construction that avoids collapsing diverged repeats and haplotypes. We demonstrate that Canu can reliably assemble complete microbial genomes and near-complete eukaryotic chromosomes using either Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore technologies and achieves a contig NG50 of {$>$}21 Mbp on both human and Drosophila melanogaster PacBio data sets. For assembly structures that cannot be linearly represented, Canu provides graph-based assembly outputs in graphical fragment assembly (GFA) format for analysis or integration with complementary phasing and scaffolding techniques. The combination of such highly resolved assembly graphs with long-range scaffolding information promises the complete and automated assembly of complex genomes.},

  abstract = {Australian Acacia species (‘wattles’) have been transported across the globe, with devastating effects in some introduced ranges where they have become invasive. However, the impact of alien taxa can be measured and quantified in many ways, which makes synthesis of their overall impacts challenging. Here we assess impacts of naturalized and invasive wattles on native biodiversity and human well-being, using two evidence-based and standardized approaches. Impact on native biodiversity was assessed using the Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) scheme, the IUCN standard for assessing impacts of alien taxa. For impacts on human well-being, we used the Socio-Economic Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (SEICAT). For environmental impacts we found 169 records, with South Africa having the highest number of records (48), followed by Portugal (26) and Spain (20). Of the 87 Acacia species assessed, most taxa with impact records available were classified as having Major impacts. This means they lead to the local extinction of at least one native species in the introduced range. However, 70 species were classified as Data Deficient under EICAT. Only 19 records were available documenting impacts on human well-being associated with seven invasive wattles, and these generally denote only Minor impacts, with one exception of a Moderate impact where farmlands were abandoned due to A. mangium invasions. This shows a significant gap in data availability for socio-economic impacts of this group. Our study provides the most complete evidence base of impacts of arguably one of the most important groups of tree invaders globally. It highlights the need to use caution when introducing and using wattles outside their native ranges, and to apply best practice guidelines if use is inevitable.},

  abstract = {Among molecular-based techniques for fungal identification, Sanger sequencing of the primary universal fungal DNA barcode, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2), is commonly used in clinical routine laboratories due to its simplicity, universality, efficacy, and affordability for fungal species identification. However, Sanger sequencing fails to identify mixed ITS sequences in the case of mixed infections. To overcome this limitation, different high-throughput sequencing technologies have been explored. The nanopore-based technology is now one of the most promising long-read sequencing technologies on the market as it has the potential to sequence the full-length ITS region in a single read. In this study, we established a workflow for species identification using the sequences of the entire ITS region generated by nanopore sequencing of both pure yeast isolates and mocked mixed species reads generated with different scenarios. The species used in this study included Candida albicans (n = 2), Candida tropicalis (n = 1), Nakaseomyces glabratus (formerly Candida glabrata) (n = 1), Trichosporon asahii (n = 2), Pichia kudriavzevii (formerly Candida krusei) (n = 1), and Cryptococcus neoformans (n = 1). Comparing various methods to generate the consensus sequence for fungal species identification, the results from this study indicate that read clustering using a modified version of the NanoCLUST pipeline is more sensitive than Canu or VSEARCH, as it classified species accurately with a lower abundance cluster of reads (3\% abundance compared to 10\% with VSEARCH). The modified NanoCLUST also reduced the number of classified clusters compared to VSEARCH, making the subsequent BLAST+ analysis faster. Subsampling of the datasets, which reduces the size of the datasets by approximately tenfold, did not significantly affect the identification results in terms of the identified species name, percent identity, query coverage, percentage of reads in the classified cluster, and the number of clusters. The ability of the method to distinguish mixed species within sub-populations of large datasets has the potential to aid computer analysis by reducing the required processing power. The herein presented new sequence analysis pipeline will facilitate better interpretation of fungal sequence data for species identification.},

Oxford nanopore technologies (ONT) trimming and filtering tools are currently rudimentary, generally only filtering reads based on whole read average quality. This results in discarding reads that contain regions of high-quality sequence. Here, we propose Prowler, a trimmer that uses a window-based approach inspired by algorithms used to trim short read data. Importantly, we retain the phase and read length information by optionally replacing trimmed sections with Ns. Results: Prowler was applied to mammalian and bacterial datasets, to assess its effect on alignment and assembly, respectively. Compared to data filtered with Nanofilt, alignments of data trimmed with Prowler had lower error rates and more mapped reads. Assemblies of Prowler trimmed data had a lower error rate than those filtered with Nanofilt; however, this came at some cost to assembly contiguity.},

  abstract = {Australian Acacia species (‘wattles’) have been introduced to many parts of the world for diverse reasons. Several of them have become invasive, resulting in negative ecological impacts. These impacts range from structural changes to invaded communities (e.g. changes in canopy cover or native plant species composition) to impacts on ecosystem functioning (e.g. nutrient and water cycling, various below- and above-ground biotic interactions) that are interlinked in complex ways and translate into changes in both ecosystem services and disservices. Introduced wattles may increase ecosystem services initially (e.g. by facilitating restoration of degraded land, increasing uses for subsistence), but over time these impacts are dwarfed by the negative impacts on ecosystem services (e.g. decreasing water availability for people and animals) or even replaced by ecosystem disservices (e.g. increased difficulty in fire control, increased soil erosion, flooding). Connections among these multiple impacts are elucidated and discussed throughout the chapter. The adverse ecological impacts of invasive wattles are well documented in several countries, notably in Portugal, South Africa and Spain. Yet, the management of invasive wattles remains challenging due to the time and monetary resources needed. There are also new opportunities to optimize the values that wattles bring to landscapes; however, once they become widespread and abundant invaders, negative impacts rapidly exceed perceived benefits, in some instances leading to regime shifts that permanently change invaded ecosystems.},

This chapter summarizes how these studies have helped solve taxonomic uncertainties, introduction histories (e.g. identifying source populations and estimating propagule pressure) and the evolutionary dynamics (e.g. the occurrence of genetic bottlenecks and admixture) of invasive wattle populations. Case studies illustrate how demographic processes have influenced the standing genetic variation in invasive wattle populations and how knowledge of evolutionary history from phylogenetic studies can aid their management. The contribution of whole-genome processes such as hybridization and polyploidy to invasiveness of wattles is discussed. The chapter concludes with suggestions for future research.}

  abstract = {Culture-based molecular identification methods have revolutionized detection of pathogens, yet these methods are slow and may yield inconclusive results from environmental materials. The second-generation sequencing tools have much-improved precision and sensitivity of detection, but these analyses are costly and may take several days to months. Of the third-generation sequencing techniques, the portable MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) has received much attention because of its small size and possibility of rapid analysis at reasonable cost. Here, we compare the relative performances of two third-generation sequencing instruments, MinION and Sequel (Pacific Biosciences), in identification and diagnostics of fungal and oomycete pathogens from conifer (Pinaceae) needles and potato (Solanum tuberosum) leaves and tubers. We demonstrate that the Sequel instrument is efficient for metabarcoding of complex samples, whereas MinION is not suited for this purpose due to a high error rate and multiple biases. However, we find that MinION can be utilized for rapid and accurate identification of dominant pathogenic organisms and other associated organisms from plant tissues following both amplicon-based and PCR-free metagenomics approaches. Using the metagenomics approach with shortened DNA extraction and incubation times, we performed the entire MinION workflow, from sample preparation through DNA extraction, sequencing, bioinformatics, and interpretation, in 2.5 h. We advocate the use of MinION for rapid diagnostics of pathogens and potentially other organisms, but care needs to be taken to control or account for multiple potential technical biases. IMPORTANCE Microbial pathogens cause enormous losses to agriculture and forestry, but current combined culturing- and molecular identification-based detection methods are too slow for rapid identification and application of countermeasures. Here, we develop new and rapid protocols for Oxford Nanopore MinION-based third-generation diagnostics of plant pathogens that greatly improve the speed of diagnostics. However, due to high error rate and technical biases in MinION, the Pacific BioSciences Sequel platform is more useful for in-depth amplicon-based biodiversity monitoring (metabarcoding) from complex environmental samples.},

  abstract = {Among the characteristics of alien plant species that are likely to influence invasion success, those that capture variation in relation to distribution and environmental requirements in their native range are of special interest. Similarly, traits such as maximum height, specific leaf area (SLA) and seed dry mass, related respectively to vegetative growth, resource use strategy, and reproductive effort and dispersal ability, have been found to vary with invasiveness. Australian Acacia species (‘wattles’) present an exceptional natural experiment for identifying traits linked with invasiveness, while applying the source-area framework and controlling for the environmental conditions within the native range. We combine large-scale data sets of the distribution and functional traits of wattles with high-resolution climate surfaces to re-examine the effect of range size, environmental niche breadths and functional traits in determining invasion status (not introduced, casual, naturalized, or invasive) in wattles. We extracted occurrence records of 1036 wattle species (96\% of all species in the genus) in Australia from the Atlas of Living Australia. For each species, we calculated the range size through the minimum convex polygon, and environmental niche breadths by matching occurrence records with WorldClim long-term average climate conditions. We extracted trait values from AusTraits and gap-filled when certain values were not known. We compared the obtained values, grouping wattle species by their introduction (not introduced vs introduced species) and invasion statuses, and calculated functional hypervolumes for each of the groups and overlaps between pairs of them. We found the performance of introduced wattle species to be profoundly influenced by their historical environment; species with broader distributions and climate niche breadths in their native range were more likely to become invasive. Trait strategies for wattles that enhance invasion consisted of maximizing plant height to promote competitive ability, displaying medium-to-high SLA values for enhanced photosynthetic activity and relative growth rate, and intermediate values of seed mass for successful establishment and sufficient seed output and dispersal.},

  abstract = {High-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) has changed our understanding of the microbial composition present in a wide range of environments. Applying HTS methods to air samples from different environments allows the identification and quantification (relative abundance) of the microorganisms present and gives a better understanding of human exposure to indoor and outdoor bioaerosols. To make full use of the avalanche of information made available by these sequences, repeated measurements must be taken, community composition described, error estimates made, correlations of microbiota with covariates (variables) must be examined, and increasingly sophisticated statistical tests must be conducted, all by using bioinformatics tools. Knowing which analysis to conduct and which tools to apply remains confusing for bioaerosol scientists, as a litany of tools and data resources are now available for characterizing microbial communities. The goal of this review paper is to offer a guided tour through the bioinformatics tools that are useful in studying the microbial ecology of bioaerosols. This work explains microbial ecology features like alpha and beta diversity, multivariate analyses, differential abundances, taxonomic analyses, visualization tools and statistical tests using bioinformatics tools for bioaerosol scientists new to the field. It illustrates and promotes the use of selected bioinformatic tools in the study of bioaerosols and serves as a good source for learning the “dos and don’ts” involved in conducting a precise microbial ecology study.},

  abstract = {Aim Understanding the genetic structure of plants in their native range is crucial when reconstructing the invasion history of weeds. This information allows researchers to pinpoint the provenance of invasive plants and to test the importance of genetic admixture in facilitating invasion success. We assessed genetic structuring across the native range of A. auriculiformis, to determine whether genetic admixture contributes to the success of this weed in its introduced range, and test for rapid adaptation to environmental conditions in the invasive lineage. Location Australia, Papua New Guinea, Florida. Taxon Earleaf acacia. Methods We sampled A. auriculiformis from across its entire native distribution (northern Australia, Papua New Guinea) and its invasive range in Florida, and used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to assess population structuring. Results Principal component analysis, based on 9591 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, indicated significant differentiation among samples from Papua New Guinea, the Northern Territory (Australia) and north Queensland (Australia). Florida samples also formed a distinct cluster, with these samples most closely related to samples from the Northern Territory. These results indicate that the Florida A. auriculiformis lineage most likely originates from the Northern Territory, with no evidence that plants were introduced from different parts of the native range. We found evidence of allelic shifts in the Florida population, suggesting rapid adaptation to environmental conditions may contribute the success of the invasive lineage. Main conclusions Two well-known biogeographic barriers—the Carpentaria Gap and Torres Strait—have caused genome-wide divergence among A. auriculiformis plants from north Queensland, Northern Territory and Papua New Guinea. The taxonomic status of these allopatric populations should be further assessed. As the Florida lineage originated in the Northern Territory, the search for potential biological control agents should be focused in this region. Our results also demonstrate how artificial selection and strong genetic drift may cause introduced plants to have a unique genetic make-up not found in the native range.},

  abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

  abstract = {Forests and woodlands in the West African Guineo-Sudanian transition zone contain many tree species that form symbiotic interactions with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. These fungi facilitate plant growth by increasing nutrient and water uptake and include many fruiting body-forming fungi, including some edible mushrooms. Despite their importance for ecosystem functioning and anthropogenic use, diversity and distribution of ECM fungi is severely under-documented in West Africa. We conducted a broad regional sampling across five West African countries using soil eDNA to characterize the ECM as well as the total soil fungal community in gallery forests and savanna woodlands dominated by ECM host tree species. We subsequently sequenced the entire ITS region and much of the LSU region to infer a phylogeny for all detected soil fungal species. Utilizing a long read sequencing approach allows for higher taxonomic resolution by using the full ITS region, while the highly conserved LSU gene allows for a more accurate higher-level assignment of species hypotheses, including species without ITS-based taxonomy assignments. We detect no overall difference in species richness between gallery forests and woodlands. However, additional gallery forest plots and more samples per plot would have been needed to firmly conclude this pattern. Based on both abundance and richness, species from the families Russulaceae and Inocybaceae dominate the ECM fungal soil communities across both vegetation types. The community structure of both total soil fungi and ECM fungi was significantly influenced by vegetation types and showed strong correlation within plots. However, we found no significant difference in fungal community structure between samples collected adjacent to different host tree species within each plot. We conclude that within plots, the fungal community is structured more by the overall ECM host plant community than by the species of the individual host tree that each sample was collected from.},

We investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the invasive species in relation to the genus as a whole. This will provide a framework for studying the evolution of traits that make Acacia species such successful invaders and could assist in screening other species for invasive potential. Location Australia and global. Methods We sequenced four plastid and two nuclear DNA regions for 110 Australian Acacia species, including 16 species that have large invasive ranges outside Australia. A Bayesian phylogenetic tree was generated to define the major lineages of Acacia and to determine the phylogenetic placement of the invasive species. Results Invasive Acacia species do not form a monophyletic group but do form small clusters throughout the phylogeny. There are no taxonomic characters that uniquely describe the invasive Acacia species. Main conclusions The legume subfamily Mimosoideae has a high percentage of invasive species and the Australian Acacia species have the highest rate of all the legumes. There is some evidence of phylogenetic clumping of invasive species of Acacia in the limited sampling presented here. This phylogeny provides a framework for further testing of the evolution of traits associated with invasiveness in Acacia.},

  abstract = {For a plant species to become invasive it has to progress along the introduction-naturalization-invasion (INI) continuum which reflects the joint direction of niche breadth. Identification of traits that correlate with and drive species invasiveness along the continuum is a major focus of invasion biology. If invasiveness is underlain by heritable traits, and if such traits are phylogenetically conserved, then we would expect non-native species with different introduction status (i.e. position along the INI continuum) to show phylogenetic signal. This study uses two clades that contain a large number of invasive tree species from the genera Acacia and Eucalyptus to test whether geographic distribution and a novel phylogenetic conservation method can predict which species have been introduced, became naturalized, and invasive. Our results suggest that no underlying phylogenetic signal underlies the introduction status for both groups of trees, except for introduced acacias. The more invasive acacia clade contains invasive species that have smoother geographic distributions and are more marginal in the phylogenetic network. The less invasive Eucalyptus group contains invasive species that are more clustered geographically, more centrally located in the phylogenetic network and have phylogenetic distances between invasive and non-invasive species that are trending toward the mean pairwise distance. This suggests that highly invasive groups may be identified because they have invasive species with smoother and faster expanding native distributions and are located closer to the edges of phylogenetic networks than less invasive groups.},

  abstract = {Background: Microbiome studies often involve sequencing a marker gene to identify the microorganisms in samples of interest. Sequence classification is a critical component of this process, whereby sequences are assigned to a reference taxonomy containing known sequence representatives of many microbial groups. Previous studies have shown that existing classification programs often assign sequences to reference groups even if they belong to novel taxonomic groups that are absent from the reference taxonomy. This high rate of "over classification" is particularly detrimental in microbiome studies because reference taxonomies are far from comprehensive. Results: Here, we introduce IDTAXA, a novel approach to taxonomic classification that employs principles from machine learning to reduce over classification errors. Using multiple reference taxonomies, we demonstrate that IDTAXA has higher accuracy than popular classifiers such as BLAST, MAPSeq, QIIME, SINTAX, SPINGO, and the RDP Classifier. Similarly, IDTAXA yields far fewer over classifications on Illumina mock microbial community data when the expected taxa are absent from the training set. Furthermore, IDTAXA offers many practical advantages over other classifiers, such as maintaining low error rates across varying input sequence lengths and withholding classifications from input sequences composed of random nucleotides or repeats. Conclusions: IDTAXA's classifications may lead to different conclusions in microbiome studies because of the substantially reduced number of taxa that are incorrectly identified through over classification. Although misclassification error is relatively minor, we believe that many remaining misclassifications are likely caused by errors in the reference taxonomy. We describe how IDTAXA is able to identify many putative mislabeling errors in reference taxonomies, enabling training sets to be automatically corrected by eliminating spurious sequences. IDTAXA is part of the DECIPHER package for the R programming language, available through the Bioconductor repository or accessible online ( http://DECIPHER.codes ).},

  abstract = {The classification of Acacia has undergone significant changes in recent years to both its taxonomy and nomenclature. A synoptic overview of these changes is presented. Phylogenetic studies, based on molecular and morphological characters, have consistently shown that the formerly broadly defined genus Acacia is not monophyletic and therefore could not be maintained as a single genus. Consequently, Acacia is now more narrowly circumscribed, but remains the largest mimosoid legume genus, comprising 1082 currently described species that are predominantly confined to Australia. The genera now excluded from the former broadly defined Acacia include the relatively large, pantropical Senegalia Raf. (221 species) and Vachellia Wight \& Arn. (164 species) and four small genera confined to the Americas, namely Acaciella Rose (15 species), Mariosousa Seigler \& Ebinger (14 species), Parasenegalia Seigler \& Ebinger (11 species) and Pseudosenegalia Seigler \& Ebinger (two species). Within Acacia the infrageneric classification has remained challenging because DNA sequencing studies have largely shown sections to be non-monophyletic and therefore artificial; work to establish an infrageneric classification based on molecular and morphological data is in progress. Therefore, for practical reasons here we describe the seven traditionally defined, morphologically based sections of Acacia, namely sect. Acacia (syn. sect. Phyllodinieae DC., 424 species), sect. Alatae (Benth.) Pedley (23 species), sect. Botrycephalae (Benth.) Taub. (48 species), sect. Juliflorae (Benth.) C.Moore \& Betche (294 species), sect. Lycopodiifoliae Pedley (24 species), sect. Plurinerves (Benth.) C.Moore \& Betche (229 species) and sect. Pulchellae (Benth.) Taub. (27 species). These sections mostly correspond to groupings of series and subseries that had been recognized previously by Bentham over 100 years ago and which were based on shared morphological characteristics. Phylogenetic information has recently been used to investigate questions about why certain Acacia species are invasive and others not, and to answer broad questions about the evolution of the genus. It is anticipated that ongoing genomic-scale DNA sequencing data collected from a comprehensive sampling of species will shed light on these important questions and in turn allow the development of a phylogenetically based, practical classification of the genus Acacia.},

Although high-throughput sequencing has greatly increased the ability to quantify the diversity of fungi in environmental samples, researchers currently lack a simple and consistent way to sort large sequence pools into ecologically meaningful categories. We address this issue by introducing FUNGuild, a tool that can be used to taxonomically parse fungal OTUs by ecological guild independent of sequencing platform or analysis pipeline. Using a database and an accompanying bioinformatics script, we demonstrate the application of FUNGuild to three high-throughput sequencing datasets from different habitats: forest soils, grassland soils, and decomposing wood. We found that guilds characteristic of each habitat (i.e., saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest soils, saprotrophic and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in grassland soils, saprotrophic, wood decomposer, and plant pathogenic fungi in decomposing wood) were each well represented. The example datasets demonstrate that while we could quickly and efficiently assign a large portion of the data to guilds, another large portion could not be assigned, reflecting the need to expand and improve the database as well as to gain a better understanding of natural history for many described and undescribed fungal species. As a community resource, FUNGuild is dependent on third-party annotation, so we invite researchers to populate it with new categories and records as well as refine those already in existence.},

There are several examples where evidence of such lineages has been sitting in public sequence databases for up to ten years before receiving scientific attention and formal recognition. In order to highlight these unidentified lineages for taxonomic scrutiny, a search function is presented that produces updated lists of approximately genus-level clusters of fungal ITS sequences that remain unidentified at the phylum, class, and order levels, respectively. The search function (https://unite.ut.ee/top50.php) is implemented in the UNITE database for molecular identification of fungi, such that the underlying sequences and fungal lineages are open to third-party annotation. We invite researchers to examine these enigmatic fungal lineages in the hope that their taxonomic resolution will not have to wait another ten years or more. Copyright R. Henrik Nilsson et al.},

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) studies of fungal communities are redrawing the map of the fungal kingdom by hinting at its enormous — and largely uncharted — taxonomic and functional diversity. However, HTS approaches come with a range of pitfalls and potential biases, cautioning against unwary application and interpretation of HTS technologies and results. In this Review, we provide an overview and practical recommendations for aspects of HTS studies ranging from sampling and laboratory practices to data processing and analysis. We also discuss upcoming trends and techniques in the field and summarize recent and noteworthy results from HTS studies targeting fungal communities and guilds. Our Review highlights the need for reproducibility and public data availability in the study of fungal communities.

The present study uses the new, ninth release of the species hypotheses of the UNITE database to show that species discovery through environmental sequencing vastly outpaces traditional, Sanger sequencing-based efforts in a strongly increasing trend over the last five years. Our findings challenge the present stance of the mycological community – that “the code” works fine and that these complications will somehow sort themselves out given enough time and a following wind – and suggest that we should be discussing not whether to allow DNA-based descriptions (typifications) of species and by extension higher ranks of fungi, but what the precise requirements for such DNA-based typifications should be. We submit a tentative list of such criteria for further discussion. However, the present authors fear that no waves of change will be lapping the shores of mycology for the foreseeable future, leaving the overwhelming majority of extant fungi without formal names and thus scientific and environmental agency. It is not clear to us who benefits from that, but neither fungi nor mycology are likely to be on the winning side.},

Oxford Nanopore's MinION is the newest third generation sequencing technology on the market. With its many advantages such as portability, user friendliness, simplicity, speed of sequencing and long read length, the technology is now an actual contender to established sequencing platforms. MinION's main disadvantage is a relatively low read accuracy compared to several other platforms, although this is constantly improving. The present study, which appears to be the first of its kind, provides the results of a preliminary analysis of the microbial communities in indoor environments based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, using both the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinIOn and the Illumina MiSeq DNA sequencers. At the level of family and above, there was no significant difference between the microbial compositions as revealed by the two platforms.

The application of nanopore sequencing to species identification has already been widely demonstrated in biomonitoring studies and has significant potential for non-human forensic casework, particularly in the area of wildlife forensics. This review examines nanopore sequencing technology and assesses its potential applications, advantages and drawbacks for use in non-human forensics, alongside other next-generation sequencing platforms and as a possible replacement to Sanger sequencing. We assess the specific challenges of sequence error rate and the standardisation of consensus sequence production, before discussing recent progress in the validation of nanopore sequencing for use in forensic casework. We conclude that nanopore sequencing may be able to play a considerable role in the future of non-human forensic genetics, especially for applications to wildlife law enforcement within emerging forensic laboratories.},

These data have been made accessible in an open-access database (http://maarjam.botany.ut.ee). • Two hundred and eighty-two SSU rRNA gene virtual taxa (VT) were described based on a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of all collated Glomeromycota sequences. Two-thirds of VT showed limited distribution ranges, occurring in single current or historic continents or climatic zones. Those VT that associated with a taxonomically wide range of host plants also tended to have a wide geographical distribution, and vice versa. No relationships were detected between VT richness and latitude, elevation or vascular plant richness. • The collated Glomeromycota molecular diversity data suggest limited distribution ranges in most Glomeromycota taxa and a positive relationship between the width of a taxon’s geographical range and its host taxonomic range. Inconsistencies between molecular and traditional taxonomy of Glomeromycota, and shortage of data from major continents and ecosystems, are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Background: Amplicon sequencing is an established and cost-efficient method for profiling microbiomes. However, many available tools to process this data require both bioinformatics skills and high computational power to process big datasets. Furthermore, there are only few tools that allow for long read amplicon data analysis. To bridge this gap, we developed the LotuS2 (less OTU scripts 2) pipeline, enabling user-friendly, resource friendly, and versatile analysis of raw amplicon sequences. Results: In LotuS2, six different sequence clustering algorithms as well as extensive pre- and post-processing options allow for flexible data analysis by both experts, where parameters can be fully adjusted, and novices, where defaults are provided for different scenarios. We benchmarked three independent gut and soil datasets, where LotuS2 was on average 29 times faster compared to other pipelines, yet could better reproduce the alpha- and beta-diversity of technical replicate samples. Further benchmarking a mock community with known taxon composition showed that, compared to the other pipelines, LotuS2 recovered a higher fraction of correctly identified taxa and a higher fraction of reads assigned to true taxa (48\% and 57\% at species; 83\% and 98\% at genus level, respectively). At ASV/OTU level, precision and F-score were highest for LotuS2, as was the fraction of correctly reported 16S sequences. Conclusion: LotuS2 is a lightweight and user-friendly pipeline that is fast, precise, and streamlined, using extensive pre- and post-ASV/OTU clustering steps to further increase data quality. High data usage rates and reliability enable high-throughput microbiome analysis in minutes. Availability: LotuS2 is available from GitHub, conda, or via a Galaxy web interface, documented at http://lotus2.earlham.ac.uk/. [MediaObject not available: see fulltext.].},

Recently, spike-in mock communities have been used to measure accuracy of sequencing platforms and data analysis pipelines. To assess the ability of sequencing platforms and data processing pipelines using fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicons, we created two ITS spike-in control mock communities composed of cloned DNA in plasmids: a biological mock community, consisting of ITS sequences from fungal taxa, and a synthetic mock community (SynMock), consisting of non-biological ITS-like sequences. Using these spike-in controls we show that: (1) a non-biological synthetic control (e.g., SynMock) is the best solution for parameterizing bioinformatics pipelines, (2) pre-clustering steps for variable length amplicons are critically important, (3) a major source of bias is attributed to the initial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and thus HTAS read abundances are typically not representative of starting values. We developed AMPtk, a versatile software solution equipped to deal with variable length amplicons and quality filter HTAS data based on spike-in controls. While we describe herein a non-biological SynMock community for ITS sequences, the concept and AMPtk software can be widely applied to any HTAS dataset to improve data quality.},

The most sensitive approaches, based on the USEARCH and VSEARCH clustering algorithms, detected almost all fungal strains but greatly overestimated the total number of strains. By contrast, approaches using DADA2 to detect amplicon sequence variants were the most effective for recovering the richness and composition of the fungal community.

Nanopore sequencers output FAST5 files containing signal data subsequently base called to FASTQ format. Optionally, ONT devices can collect data from all sequencing channels simultaneously in a bulk FAST5 file enabling inspection of signal in any channel at any point. We sought to visualize this signal to inspect challenging or difficult to sequence samples. RESULTS: The BulkVis tool can load a bulk FAST5 file and overlays MinKNOW (the software that controls ONT sequencers) classifications on the signal trace and can show mappings to a reference. Users can navigate to a channel and time or, given a FASTQ header from a read, jump to its specific position. BulkVis can export regions as Nanopore base caller compatible reads. Using BulkVis, we find long reads can be incorrectly divided by MinKNOW resulting in single DNA molecules being split into two or more reads. The longest seen to date is 2\enspace 272\enspace 580 bases in length and reported in eleven consecutive reads. We provide helper scripts that identify and reconstruct split reads given a sequencing summary file and alignment to a reference. We note that incorrect read splitting appears to vary according to input sample type and is more common in 'ultra-long' read preparations.

There is somewhere between 2–11 million estimated species, but the number of formally described taxa is around 150,000, a tiny fraction of the total. In this paper, we examine 12 ascomycete genera as case studies to establish trends in fungal species descriptions, and introduce new species in each genus. To highlight the importance of traditional morpho-molecular methods in publishing new species, we introduce novel taxa in 12 genera that are considered to have low species discovery. We discuss whether the species are likely to be rare or due to a lack of extensive sampling and classification. The genera are Apiospora, Bambusicola, Beltrania, Capronia, Distoseptispora, Endocalyx, Neocatenulostroma, Neodeightonia, Paraconiothyrium, Peroneutypa, Phaeoacremonium and Vanakripa. We discuss host-specificity in selected genera and compare the number of species epithets in each genus with the number of ITS (barcode) sequences deposited in GenBank and UNITE. We furthermore discuss the relationship between the divergence times of these genera with those of their hosts. We hypothesize whether there might be more species in these genera and discuss hosts and habitats that should be investigated for novel species discovery.},

Current popular bioinformatic pipelines support microbial and fungal marker analysis, while ad hoc methods are often used to process animal metabarcode markers from the same study. MetaWorks provides a harmonized processing environment, pipeline, and taxonomic assignment approach for demultiplexed Illumina reads for all biota using a wide range of metabarcoding markers such as 16S, ITS, and COI. A Conda environment is provided to quickly gather most of the programs and dependencies for the pipeline. Several workflows are provided such as: taxonomically assigning exact sequence variants, provides an option to generate operational taxonomic units, and facilitates single-read processing. Pipelines are automated using Snakemake to minimize user intervention and facilitate scalability. All pipelines use the RDP classifier to provide taxonomic assignments with confidence measures. We extend the functionality of the RDP classifier for taxonomically assigning 16S (bacteria), ITS (fungi), and 28S (fungi), to also support COI (eukaryotes), rbcL (eukaryotes, land plants, diatoms), 12S (fish, vertebrates), 18S (eukaryotes, diatoms) and ITS (fungi, plants). MetaWorks properly handles ITS by trimming flanking conserved rRNA gene regions as well as protein coding genes by providing two options for removing obvious pseudogenes. MetaWorks can be downloaded from https://github.com/terrimporter/MetaWorks and quickstart instructions, pipeline details, and a tutorial for new users can be found at https://terrimporter.github.io/MetaWorksSite.},

  abstract = {Long-read shotgun metagenomic sequencing is gaining in popularity and offers many advantages over short-read sequencing. The higher information content in long reads is useful for a variety of metagenomics analyses, including taxonomic classification and profiling. The development of long-read specific tools for taxonomic classification is accelerating, yet there is a lack of information regarding their relative performance. Here, we perform a critical benchmarking study using 11 methods, including five methods designed specifically for long reads. We applied these tools to several mock community datasets generated using Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi or Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing, and evaluated their performance based on read utilization, detection metrics, and relative abundance estimates. Our results show that long-read classifiers generally performed best. Several short-read classification and profiling methods produced many false positives (particularly at lower abundances), required heavy filtering to achieve acceptable precision (at the cost of reduced recall), and produced inaccurate abundance estimates. By contrast, two long-read methods (BugSeq, MEGAN-LR \& DIAMOND) and one generalized method (sourmash) displayed high precision and recall without any filtering required. Furthermore, in the PacBio HiFi datasets these methods detected all species down to the 0.1\% abundance level with high precision. Some long-read methods, such as MetaMaps and MMseqs2, required moderate filtering to reduce false positives to resemble the precision and recall of the top-performing methods. We found read quality affected performance for methods relying on protein prediction or exact k-mer matching, and these methods performed better with PacBio HiFi datasets. We also found that long-read datasets with a large proportion of shorter reads ({$<$} 2 kb length) resulted in lower precision and worse abundance estimates, relative to length-filtered datasets. Finally, for classification methods, we found that the long-read datasets produced significantly better results than short-read datasets, demonstrating clear advantages for long-read metagenomic sequencing. Our critical assessment of available methods provides best-practice recommendations for current research using long reads and establishes a baseline for future benchmarking studies.},

  abstract = {Within uncharacterized groups, DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences that are present in a wide range of species, can be used to assign organisms into species. We propose an automatic procedure that sorts the sequences into hypothetical species based on the barcode gap, which can be observed whenever the divergence among organisms belonging to the same species is smaller than divergence among organisms from different species. We use a range of prior intraspecific divergence to infer from the data a model-based one-sided confidence limit for intraspecific divergence. The method, called Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), then detects the barcode gap as the first significant gap beyond this limit and uses it to partition the data. Inference of the limit and gap detection are then recursively applied to previously obtained groups to get finer partitions until there is no further partitioning. Using six published data sets of metazoans, we show that ABGD is computationally efficient and performs well for standard prior maximum intraspecific divergences (a few per cent of divergence for the five data sets), except for one data set where less than three sequences per species were sampled. We further explore the theoretical limitations of ABGD through simulation of explicit speciation and population genetics scenarios. Our results emphasize in particular the sensitivity of the method to the presence of recent speciation events, via (unrealistically) high rates of speciation or large numbers of species. In conclusion, ABGD is fast, simple method to split a sequence alignment data set into candidate species that should be complemented with other evidence in an integrative taxonomic approach. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {The number of studies dealing with plant invasions is increasing rapidly, but the accumulating body of knowledge has unfortunately also spawned increasing confusion about terminology. Invasions are a global phenomenon and comparison of geographically distant regions and their introduced biota is a crucially important methodological approach for elucidation of the determinants of invasiveness and invasibility. Comparative studies of alien floras provide substantial new insights to our understanding of general patterns of plant invasions. Such studies, using information in previously published floras and checklists, are fundamentally dependent on the quality of the assessment of particular species with respect to their taxonomic identity, time of immigration and invasion status. Three crucial decisions should be made when defining the status of a plant species in a given region: (1) whether the taxon is native or alien to that region (origin status); (2) what is its position in the invasion process, i.e., when was it introduced (residence status); and (3) what is the degree of its naturalization and possible invasion (invasion status). Standard floras differ hugely in their treatment of non­native species and those with appropriate categorization of alien species according to their status are rather rare. The present paper suggests definitions of terms associated with plant invasions and places these into the context of floras. Recommendations are outlined on how to deal with the issue of plant invasions in standard floras with the aim of contributing to a better understanding between taxonomists and ecologists and allowing more detailed comparative analyses of alien floras of various regions of the world.},

The number of reads were 673,711 and 779,899, respectively, after quality filtering. Within the benthic sites, more than 80\% of the sequences could not be classified taxonomically. The phylum composition of the classifiable sequences was dominated in both localities by Dikarya, which made up around 33\% of the OTUs. Within Dikarya, Ascomycota was the dominant phylum. Guild assignment failed for more than half of the classifiable OTUs, with undefined saprotrophs being the most common resolved guild. This guild classification was slightly more common in the ocean sediment samples than in the terrestrial ones. Our metadata indicated that ocean sites contain organisms at a lower trophic level and that there are predominantly endophytic, parasitic, and pathogenic fungi in the marine environments. This hints at the presence of interesting and currently poorly understood fungus-driven ecological processes. It is also clear from our results that a very large number of marine fungi are in urgent need of taxonomic study and formal description.},

The highly-contiguous de novo assemblies using PacBio sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and characterize structural variation (SV) in personal genomes. With longer reads, we can sequence through extended repetitive regions and detect mutations, many of which are associated with diseases. Moreover, PacBio transcriptome sequencing is advantageous for the identification of gene isoforms and facilitates reliable discoveries of novel genes and novel isoforms of annotated genes, due to its ability to sequence full-length transcripts or fragments with significant lengths. Additionally, PacBio's sequencing technique provides information that is useful for the direct detection of base modifications, such as methylation. In addition to using PacBio sequencing alone, many hybrid sequencing strategies have been developed to make use of more accurate short reads in conjunction with PacBio long reads. In general, hybrid sequencing strategies are more affordable and scalable especially for small-size laboratories than using PacBio Sequencing alone. The advent of PacBio sequencing has made available much information that could not be obtained via SGS alone.},

Although there is a fossil record of species invasions occurring in waves after geographic barriers had been lifted, such episodic events differ markedly from human-assisted invasions in spatial and temporal scales and in the number and diversity of organisms involved in long-distance dispersal. Today, every region of the planet is simultaneously affected and modern rates of invasion are several orders of magnitude higher than prehistoric rates. In terms of its rate and geographical extent, its potential for synergistic disruption and the scope of its evolutionary consequences, the current mass invasion event is without precedent and should be regarded as a unique form of global change. Prehistoric examples of biotic interchanges are nonetheless instructive and can increase our understanding of species-area effects, evolutionary effects, biotic resistance to invasion, and the impacts of novel functional groups introduced to naïve biotas. Nevertheless, they provide only limited insight into the synergistic effects of invasions and other environmental stressors, the effect of frequent introductions of large numbers of propagules, and global homogenization, all of which characterize the current mass invasion event.},

Some species are commercially important as forestry trees, others are widely planted for sand stabilization or revegetation, used in different forms of agroforestry, planted as ornamentals, or provide other benefits. At least 75 species have established self-sustaining populations outside their native ranges and 28 are invasive, in many cases causing substantial ecological and socio-economic impacts.

  abstract = {Aim Australian acacias (1012 recognized species native to Australia, which were previously grouped in Acacia subgenus Phyllodineae) have been moved extensively around the world by humans over the past 250 years. This has created the opportunity to explore how evolutionary, ecological, historical and sociological factors interact to affect the distribution, usage, invasiveness and perceptions of a globally important group of plants. This editorial provides the background for the 20 papers in this special issue of Diversity and Distributions that focusses on the global cross-disciplinary experiment of introduced Australian acacias. Location Australia and global. Methods The papers of the special issue are discussed in the context of a unified framework for biological invasions. Distributions of species were mapped across Australia, their representation in bioclimatic zones examined and the potential global distribution of the group modelled. By collating a variety of different lists, we determined which Australian acacias have reached different stages in the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum in different parts of the world. Paradigms and key research questions relating to barriers to invasion, stages of invasion and management perceptions are sketched. Results According to our global database of Australian acacia records, 386 species have been moved outside Australia by human agency, 71 species are naturalized or weedy, and 23 are unequivocally invasive. Climatic models suggest that about a third of the world’s land surface is climatically suitable for Australian acacias. Many species are commercially important crops or are useful for other purposes and have been extensively planted, and many different human perceptions of Australian acacias exist in different parts of the world. The papers in the special issue cover all the barriers, stages and processes that define biological invasions and touch on many aspects: history and the human dimension; aspects of the species pool; species traits; biotic interactions; climate and niche; and management. Main conclusions Australian acacias are an excellent model group for examining interactions between evolutionary, ecological and socio-economic drivers of species introductions. New insights have emerged on the biological, ecological and evolutionary correlates of naturalization and invasion, but human usage factors permeate all explanatory models. Understanding and managing introduced Australian acacias requires a fundamental and integrative appreciation of both intrinsic (e.g. species traits) and extrinsic (e.g. human usage and perceptions) aspects.},

  abstract = {The literature on biological invasions is biased in favour of invasive species – those that spread and often reach high abundance following introduction by humans. It is, however, also important to understand previous stages in the introduction–naturalization–invasion continuum (‘the continuum’), especially the factors that mediate naturalization. The emphasis on invasiveness is partly because most invasions are only recognized once species occupy large adventive ranges or start to spread. Also, many studies lump all alien species, and fail to separate introduced, naturalized and invasive populations and species. These biases impede our ability to elucidate the full suite of drivers of invasion and to predict invasion dynamics, because different factors mediate progression along different sections of the continuum. A better understanding of the determinants of naturalization is important because all naturalized species are potential invaders. Processes leading to naturalization act differently in different regions and global biogeographical patterns of plant invasions result from the interaction of population-biological, macroecological and human-induced factors. We explore what is known about how determinants of naturalization in plants interact at various scales, and how their importance varies along the continuum. Research that is explicitly linked to particular stages of the continuum can generate new information that is appropriate for improving the management of biological invasions if, for example, potentially invasive species are identified before they exert an impact.

  abstract = {Abstract. Much confusion exists in the English-language literature on plant invasions concerning the terms ‘naturalized’ and ‘invasive’ and their associated concepts. Several authors have used these terms in proposing schemes for conceptualizing the sequence of events from introduction to invasion, but often imprecisely, erroneously or in contradictory ways. This greatly complicates the formulation of robust generalizations in invasion ecology. Based on an extensive and critical survey of the literature we defined a minimum set of key terms related to a graphic scheme which conceptualizes the naturalization/invasion process. Introduction means that the plant (or its propagule) has been transported by humans across a major geographical barrier. Naturalization starts when abiotic and biotic barriers to survival are surmounted and when various barriers to regular reproduction are overcome. Invasion further requires that introduced plants produce reproductive offspring in areas distant from sites of introduction (approximate scales: {$>$} 100 m over {$<$} 50 years for taxa spreading by seeds and other propagules; {$>$} 6 m/3 years for taxa spreading by roots, rhizomes, stolons or creeping stems). Taxa that can cope with the abiotic environment and biota in the general area may invade disturbed, seminatural communities. Invasion of successionally mature, undisturbed communities usually requires that the alien taxon overcomes a different category of barriers. We propose that the term ‘invasive’ should be used without any inference to environmental or economic impact. Terms like ‘pests’ and ‘weeds’ are suitable labels for the 50–80\% of invaders that have harmful effects. About 10\% of invasive plants that change the character, condition, form, or nature of ecosystems over substantial areas may be termed ‘transformers’.},

  abstract = {Aim Woody plants were not widely considered to be important invasive alien species until fairly recently. Thousands of species of trees and shrubs have, however, been moved around the world. Many species have spread from planting sites, and some are now among the most widespread and damaging of invasive organisms. This article presents a global list of invasive alien trees and shrubs. It discusses taxonomic biases, geographical patterns, modes of dispersal, reasons for introductions and key issues regarding invasions of non-native woody plants around the world. Location Global. Methods An exhaustive survey was made of regional and national databases and the literature. Correspondence with botanists and ecologists and our own observations in many parts of the world expanded the list. Presence of invasive species was determined for each of 15 broad geographical regions. The main reasons for introduction and dissemination were determined for each species. Results The list comprises 622 species (357 trees, 265 shrubs in 29 plant orders, 78 families, 286 genera). Regions with the largest number of woody invasive alien species are: Australia (183); southern Africa (170); North America (163); Pacific Islands (147); and New Zealand (107). Species introduced for horticulture dominated the list (62\% of species: 196 trees and 187 shrubs). The next most important reasons for introduction and dissemination were forestry (13\%), food (10\%) and agroforestry (7\%). Three hundred and twenty-three species (52\%) are currently known to be invasive in only one region, and another 126 (20\%) occur in only two regions. Only 38 species (6\%) are very widespread (invasive in six or more regions). Over 40\% of invasive tree species and over 60\% of invasive shrub species are bird dispersed. Main conclusions Only between 0.5\% and 0.7\% of the world’s tree and shrub species are currently invasive outside their natural range, but woody plant invasions are rapidly increasing in importance around the world. The objectively compiled list of invasive species presented here provides a snapshot of the current dimensions of the phenomenon and will be useful for screening new introductions for invasive potential.},

  abstract = {We present a performance-optimized algorithm, subsampled open-reference OTU picking, for assigning marker gene (e.g., 16S rRNA) sequences generated on nextgeneration sequencing platforms to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for microbial community analysis. This algorithm provides benefits over de novo OTU picking (clustering can be performed largely in parallel, reducing runtime) and closedreference OTU picking (all reads are clustered, not only those that match a reference database sequence with high similarity). Because more of our algorithm can be run in parallel relative to "classic" open-reference OTU picking, it makes open-reference OTU picking tractable on massive amplicon sequence data sets (though on smaller data sets, "classic" open-reference OTU clustering is often faster).We illustrate that here by applying it to the first 15,000 samples sequenced for the EarthMicrobiome Project (1.3 billion V4 16S rRNA amplicons). To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest OTU picking run ever performed, and we estimate that our new algorithm runs in less than 1/5 the time than would be required of "classic" open reference OTU picking.We show that subsampled open-reference OTU picking yields results that are highly correlated with those generated by "classic" open-reference OTU picking through comparisons on three well-studied datasets. An implementation of this algorithm is provided in the popular QIIME software package, which uses uclust for read clustering. All analyses were performed using QIIME's uclust wrappers, though we provide details (aided by the open-source code in our GitHub repository) that will allow implementation of subsampled open-reference OTU picking independently of QIIME (e.g., in a compiled programming language, where runtimes should be further reduced). Our analyses should generalize to other implementations of these OTU picking algorithms. Finally, we present a comparison of parameter settings in QIIME's OTU picking workflows and make recommendations on settings for these free parameters to optimize runtime without reducing the quality of the results. These optimized parameters can vastly decrease the runtime of uclust-based OTU picking in QIIME. © 2014 Rideout et al.},

  abstract = {The internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region between the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene and large subunit ribosomal RNA gene is a widely used phylogenetic marker for fungi and other taxa. The eukaryotic ITS contains the conserved 5.8S rRNA and is divided into the ITS1 and ITS2 hypervariable regions. These regions are variable in length and are amplified using primers complementary to the conserved regions of their flanking genes. Previous work has shown that removing the conserved regions results in more accurate taxonomic classification. An existing software program, ITSx, is capable of trimming FASTA sequences by matching hidden Markov model profiles to the ends of the conserved genes using the software suite HMMER. ITSxpress was developed to extend this technique from marker gene studies using Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU's) to studies using exact sequence variants; a method used by the software packages Dada2, Deblur, QIIME 2, and Unoise. The sequence variant approach uses the quality scores of each read to identify sequences that are statistically likely to represent real sequences. ITSxpress enables this by processing FASTQ rather than FASTA files. The software also speeds up the trimming of reads by a factor of 14-23 times on a 4-core computer by temporarily clustering highly similar sequences that are common in amplicon data and utilizing optimized parameters for Hmmsearch. ITSxpress is available as a QIIME 2 plugin and a stand-alone application installable from the Python package index, Bioconda, and Github.},

It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use. Methods When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads. Results VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0. Discussion VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH.

In this study we assessed the efficiency of long-read high throughput sequencing (HTS) as opposed to the traditionally used Sanger method for taxonomic identification of multiple vouchered fungal specimens. We also evaluated whether this method can provide reference information about intraindividual gene polymorphism. We developed a workflow based on a test set of 423 basidiomycete specimens (representing 195 species), the PacBio HTS method, and ribosomal rRNA operon internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28S rRNA gene (LSU) markers. The PacBio HTS had a higher success rate than Sanger sequencing at a comparable cost. Species identification based on PacBio reads was usually straightforward, because the dominant operational taxonomic unit (OTU) typically represented the targeted organism. The PacBio HTS also enabled us to detect widespread polymorphism within the ITS marker. We conclude that multiplex DNA barcoding of the fungal ITS and LSU markers using PacBio HTS is a useful tool for taxonomic identification of large amounts of collected voucher specimens at a competitive price. Furthermore, PacBio HTS accurately recovers various alleles and paralogues, which can provide crucial information for species delimitation and population-level studies.},

Being able to use nanopore-only data would be a significant advance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have recently released a new flowcell (R10.4) and chemistry (Kit12), which reportedly generate per-read accuracies rivalling those of Illumina data. To evaluate this, we sequenced DNA extracts from four commonly studied bacterial pathogens, namely \&\#160;\&\#160;Escherichia coli\&\#160;\&\#160;, \&\#160;\&\#160;Klebsiella pneumoniae\&\#160;\&\#160;, \&\#160;\&\#160;Pseudomonas aeruginosa\&\#160;\&\#160; and \&\#160;\&\#160;Staphylococcus aureus\&\#160;\&\#160;, using Illumina and ONT’s R9.4.1/Kit10, R10.3/Kit12, R10.4/Kit12 flowcells/chemistries. We compared raw read accuracy and assembly accuracy for each modality, considering the impact of different nanopore basecalling models, commonly used assemblers, sequencing depth, and the use of duplex versus simplex reads. ‘Super accuracy’ (sup) basecalled R10.4 reads - in particular duplex reads - have high per-read accuracies and could be used to robustly reconstruct bacterial genomes without the use of Illumina data. However, the per-run yield of duplex reads generated in our hands with standard sequencing protocols was low (typically \&lt;10{$\mkern1mu\%$}), with substantial implications for cost and throughput if relying on nanopore data only to enable bacterial genome reconstruction. In addition, recovery of small plasmids with the best-performing long-read assembler (Flye) was inconsistent. R10.4/Kit12 combined with sup basecalling holds promise as a singular sequencing technology in the reconstruction of commonly studied bacterial genomes, but hybrid assembly (Illumina+R9.4.1 hac) currently remains the highest throughput, most robust, and cost-effective approach to fully reconstruct these bacterial genomes.},

  abstract = {Assessment of bacterial diversity through sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) genes has been an approach widely used in environmental microbiology, particularly since the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. An additional innovation introduced by these technologies was the need of developing new strategies to manage and investigate the massive amount of sequencing data generated. This situation stimulated the rapid expansion of the field of bioinformatics with the release of new tools to be applied to the downstream analysis and interpretation of sequencing data mainly generated using Illumina technology. In recent years, a third generation of sequencing technologies has been developed and have been applied in parallel and complementarily to the former sequencing strategies. In particular, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) introduced nanopore sequencing which has become very popular among molecular ecologists. Nanopore technology offers a low price, portability and fast sequencing throughput. This powerful technology has been recently tested for 16S rRNA analyses showing promising results. However, compared with previous technologies, there is a scarcity of bioinformatic tools and protocols designed specifically for the analysis of Nanopore 16S sequences. Due its notable characteristics, researchers have recently started performing assessments regarding the suitability MinION on 16S rRNA sequencing studies, and have obtained remarkable results. Here we present a review of the state-of-the-art of MinION technology applied to microbiome studies, the current possible application and main challenges for its use on 16S rRNA metabarcoding.},

  abstract = {The DNA sequences encoding ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) are commonly used as markers to identify species, including in metagenomics samples that may combine many organismal communities. The 16S small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene is typically used to identify bacterial and archaeal species. The nuclear 18S SSU rRNA gene, and 28S large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene have been used as DNA barcodes and for phylogenetic studies in different eukaryote taxonomic groups. Because of their popularity, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) receives a disproportionate number of rRNA sequence submissions and BLAST queries. These sequences vary in quality, length, origin (nuclear, mitochondria, plastid), and organism source and can represent any region of the ribosomal cistron. To improve the timely verification of quality, origin and loci boundaries, we developed Ribovore, a software package for sequence analysis of rRNA sequences. The ribotyper and ribosensor programs are used to validate incoming sequences of bacterial and archaeal SSU rRNA. The ribodbmaker program is used to create high-quality datasets of rRNAs from different taxonomic groups. Key algorithmic steps include comparing candidate sequences against rRNA sequence profile hidden Markov models (HMMs) and covariance models of rRNA sequence and secondary-structure conservation, as well as other tests. Nine freely available blastn rRNA databases created and maintained with Ribovore are used for checking incoming GenBank submissions and used by the blastn browser interface at NCBI. Since 2018, Ribovore has been used to analyze more than 50 million prokaryotic SSU rRNA sequences submitted to GenBank, and to select at least 10,435 fungal rRNA RefSeq records from type material of 8350 taxa. Ribovore combines single-sequence and profile-based methods to improve GenBank processing and analysis of rRNA sequences. It is a standalone, portable, and extensible software package for the alignment, classification and validation of rRNA sequences. Researchers planning on submitting SSU rRNA sequences to GenBank are encouraged to download and use Ribovore to analyze their sequences prior to submission to determine which sequences are likely to be automatically accepted into GenBank.},

A fundamental assumption of this approach is the reliance on being able to track tagged amplicons back to the samples from which they originated. In this study, we address the problem of sequences in metabarcoding sequencing outputs with false combinations of used tags (tag jumps). Unless these sequences can be identified and excluded from downstream analyses, tag jumps creating sequences with false, but already used tag combinations, can cause incorrect assignment of sequences to samples and artificially inflate diversity. In this study, we document and investigate tag jumping in metabarcoding studies on Illumina sequencing platforms by amplifying mixed-template extracts obtained from bat droppings and leech gut contents with tagged generic arthropod and mammal primers, respectively. We found that an average of 2.6\% and 2.1\% of sequences had tag combinations, which could be explained by tag jumping in the leech and bat diet study, respectively. We suggest that tag jumping can happen during blunt-ending of pools of tagged amplicons during library build and as a consequence of chimera formation during bulk amplification of tagged amplicons during library index PCR. We argue that tag jumping and contamination between libraries represents a considerable challenge for Illumina-based metabarcoding studies, and suggest measures to avoid false assignment of tag jumping-derived sequences to samples.},

  abstract = {Six DNA regions were evaluated as potential DNA barcodes for Fungi, the second largest kingdom of eukaryotic life, by a multinational, multilaboratory consortium. The region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 used as the animal barcode was excluded as a potential marker, because it is difficult to amplify in fungi, often includes large introns, and can be insufficiently variable. Three subunits from the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron were compared together with regions of three representative protein-coding genes (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and minichromosome maintenance protein). Although the protein-coding gene regions often had a higher percent of correct identification compared with ribosomal markers, low PCR amplification and sequencing success eliminated them as candidates for a universal fungal barcode. Among the regions of the ribosomal cistron, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region has the highest probability of successful identification for the broadest range of fungi, with the most clearly defined barcode gap between inter- and intraspecific variation. The nuclear ribosomal large subunit, a popular phylogenetic marker in certain groups, had superior species resolution in some taxonomic groups, such as the early diverging lineages and the ascomycete yeasts, but was otherwise slightly inferior to the ITS. The nuclear ribosomal small subunit has poor species-level resolution in fungi. ITS will be formally proposed for adoption as the primary fungal barcode marker to the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, with the possibility that supplementary barcodes may be developed for particular narrowly circumscribed taxonomic groups.},

  abstract = {Highly parallel SNP genotyping platforms have been developed for some important crop species, but these platforms typically carry a high cost per sample for first-time or small-scale users. In contrast, recently developed genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approaches offer a highly cost effective alternative for simultaneous SNP discovery and genotyping. In the present investigation, we have explored the use of GBS in soybean. In addition to developing a novel analysis pipeline to call SNPs and indels from the resulting sequence reads, we have devised a modified library preparation protocol to alter the degree of complexity reduction. We used a set of eight diverse soybean genotypes to conduct a pilot scale test of the protocol and pipeline. Using ApeKI for GBS library preparation and sequencing on an Illumina GAIIx machine, we obtained 5.5 M reads and these were processed using our pipeline. A total of 10,120 high quality SNPs were obtained and the distribution of these SNPs mirrored closely the distribution of gene-rich regions in the soybean genome. A total of 39.5\% of the SNPs were present in genic regions and 52.5\% of these were located in the coding sequence. Validation of over 400 genotypes at a set of randomly selected SNPs using Sanger sequencing showed a 98\% success rate. We then explored the use of selective primers to achieve a greater complexity reduction during GBS library preparation. The number of SNP calls could be increased by almost 40\% and their depth of coverage was more than doubled, thus opening the door to an increase in the throughput and a significant decrease in the per sample cost. The approach to obtain high quality SNPs developed here will be helpful for marker assisted genomics as well as assessment of available genetic resources for effective utilisation in a wide number of species.},

We propose the basecRAWller algorithm, a pair of unidirectional recurrent neural networks that enables the calling of DNA bases in real time directly from the rawest form of nanopore output. This shift in nanopore basecalling provides a number of advantages over current processing pipelines including: 1) streaming basecalling, 2) tunable ratio of insertions to deletions, and 3) potential for streaming detection of modified bases. Key to the streaming basecalling capability is sequence prediction at a delay of less than 1/100th of a second, allowing future signal to continuously modulate sequence prediction. BasecRAWller is computationally efficient enabling basecalling at speeds faster than current nanopore instrument measurement speeds on a single core. Further, basecalling can be paused and resumed without any change in the resulting predicted sequence, transforming the potential applications for dynamic read rejection capabilities. The basecRAWller algorithm provides an alternative approach to nanopore basecalling at comparable accuracy and provides the community with the capacity to train their own basecRAWller neural networks with minimal effort.},

Although a significant amount of effort has gone into understanding the error profiles of DNA sequencers, little has been done to understand the downstream effects of the PCR amplification protocol. We quantified the effects of the choice of polymerase and number of PCR cycles on the quality of downstream data. We found that these choices can have a profound impact on the way that a microbial community is represented in the sequence data. The effects are relatively small compared to the variation in human stool samples; however, care should be taken to use polymerases with the highest possible fidelity and to minimize the number of rounds of PCR. These results also underscore that it is not possible to directly compare sequence data generated under different PCR conditions.           ,              ABSTRACT             PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes is a critical yet underappreciated step in the generation of sequence data to describe the taxonomic composition of microbial communities. Numerous factors in the design of PCR can impact the sequencing error rate, the abundance of chimeric sequences, and the degree to which the fragments in the product represent their abundance in the original sample (i.e., bias). We compared the performance of high fidelity polymerases and various numbers of rounds of amplification when amplifying a mock community and human stool samples. Although it was impossible to derive specific recommendations, we did observe general trends. Namely, using a polymerase with the highest possible fidelity and minimizing the number of rounds of PCR reduced the sequencing error rate, fraction of chimeric sequences, and bias. Evidence of bias at the sequence level was subtle and could not be ascribed to the fragments’ fraction of bases that were guanines or cytosines. When analyzing mock community data, the amount that the community deviated from the expected composition increased with the number of rounds of PCR. This bias was inconsistent for human stool samples. Overall, the results underscore the difficulty of comparing sequence data that are generated by different PCR protocols. However, the results indicate that the variation in human stool samples is generally larger than that introduced by the choice of polymerase or number of rounds of PCR.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) corresponds to a mixture of genomic DNA from many different organisms found in an environmental sample such as water, soil, or feces. DNA metabarcoding can be defined as the simultaneous DNA-based identification of many taxa found in the same eDNA extract. It is usually based on the analysis of a metabarcode (i.e., a short and taxonomically informative DNA region). Metagenomics refers to the assembly and functional analysis of the different genomes found in an environmental sample, while metatranscriptomics examines gene expression and regulation at the sampling time based on the set of RNAs extracted from such a sample. Chapter also presents a brief history of eDNA, highlights the different steps of an eDNA study, and gives an overview of the different eDNA methods implemented in ecological research or biodiversity management.},

We sought to design internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers and an Illumina protocol that would maximize coverage of the kingdom Fungi while minimizing nontarget eukaryotes. We inspected alignments of the 5.8S and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal genes and evaluated potential primers using PrimerProspector. We tested the resulting primers using tiered-abundance mock communities and five previously characterized soil samples. We recovered operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to all 8 members in both mock communities, despite DNA abundances spanning 3 orders of magnitude. The expected and observed read counts were strongly correlated (r=0.94 to 0.97). However, several taxa were consistently over- or underrepresented, likely due to variation in rRNA gene copy numbers. The Illumina data resulted in clustering of soil samples identical to that obtained with Sanger sequence clone library data using different primers. Furthermore, the two methods produced distance matrices with a Mantel correlation of 0.92. Nonfungal sequences comprised less than 0.5\% of the soil data set, with most attributable to vascular plants. Our results suggest that high-throughput methods can produce fairly accurate estimates of fungal abundances in complex communities. Further improvements might be achieved through corrections for rRNA copy number and utilization of standardized mock communities.}

This study was initiated to quantify potential biases in fungal community ecology by comparing the relative performance of amplicon-free shotgun metagenomics and amplicons of nine primer pairs over seven nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) regions often used in metabarcoding analyses. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) barcodes ITS1 and ITS2 provided greater taxonomic and functional resolution and richness of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the 97\% similarity threshold compared to barcodes located within the ribosomal small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) genes. All barcode-primer pair combinations provided consistent results in ranking taxonomic richness and recovering the importance of floristic variables in driving fungal community composition in soils of Papua New Guinea. The choice of forward primer explained up to 2.0\% of the variation in OTU-level analysis of the ITS1 and ITS2 barcode data sets. Across the whole data set, barcode-primer pair combination explained 37.6-38.1\% of the variation, which surpassed any environmental signal. Overall, the metagenomics data set recovered a similar taxonomic overview, but resulted in much lower fungal rDNA sequencing depth, inability to infer OTUs, and high uncertainty in identification. We recommend the use of ITS2 or the whole ITS region for metabarcoding and we advocate careful choice of primer pairs in consideration of the relative proportion of fungal DNA and expected dominant groups.},

  abstract = {Second-generation, high-throughput sequencing methods have greatly improved our understanding of the ecology of soil microorganisms, yet the short barcodes ({$<$} 500 bp) provide limited taxonomic and phylogenetic information for species discrimination and taxonomic assignment. Here, we utilized the third-generation Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RSII and Sequel instruments to evaluate the suitability of full-length internal transcribed spacer (ITS) barcodes and longer rRNA gene amplicons for metabarcoding Fungi, Oomycetes and other eukaryotes in soil samples. Metabarcoding revealed multiple errors and biases: Taq polymerase substitution errors and mis-incorporating indels in sequencing homopolymers constitute major errors; sequence length biases occur during PCR, library preparation, loading to the sequencing instrument and quality filtering; primer–template mismatches bias the taxonomic profile when using regular and highly degenerate primers. The RSII and Sequel platforms enable the sequencing of amplicons up to 3000 bp, but the sequence quality remains slightly inferior to Illumina sequencing especially in longer amplicons. The full ITS barcode and flanking rRNA small subunit gene greatly improve taxonomic identification at the species and phylum levels, respectively. We conclude that PacBio sequencing provides a viable alternative for metabarcoding of organisms that are of relatively low diversity, require {$>$} 500-bp barcode for reliable identification or when phylogenetic approaches are intended.},

Here we provide an overview of current best practices in metabarcoding analysis of fungal communities, from experimental design through molecular and computational analyses. By reanalysing published data sets, we demonstrate that operational taxonomic units (OTUs) outperform amplified sequence variants (ASVs) in recovering fungal diversity, a finding that is particularly evident for long markers. Additionally, analysis of the full-length ITS region allows more accurate taxonomic placement of fungi and other eukaryotes compared to the ITS2 subregion. Finally, we show that specific methods for compositional data analyses provide more reliable estimates of shifts in community structure. We conclude that metabarcoding analyses of fungi are especially promising for integrating fungi into the full microbiome and broader ecosystem functioning context, recovery of novel fungal lineages and ancient organisms as well as barcoding of old specimens including type material.},

Today, research on the diversity of eukaryotes in global ecosystems heavily relies on nuclear ribosomal RNA (rRNA) markers. Here, we present the research community-curated reference database EUKARYOME for nuclear ribosomal 18S rRNA, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28S rRNA markers for all eukaryotes, including metazoans (animals), protists, fungi and plants. It is particularly useful for the identification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi as it bridges the four commonly used molecular markers—ITS1, ITS2, 18S V4–V5 and 28S D1–D2 subregions. The key benefits of this database over other annotated reference sequence databases are that it is not restricted to certain taxonomic groups and it includes all rRNA markers. EUKARYOME also offers a number of reference long-read sequences that are derived from (meta)genomic and (meta)barcoding—a unique feature that can be used for taxonomic identification and chimera control of third-generation, long-read, high-throughput sequencing data. Taxonomic assignments of rRNA genes in the database are verified based on phylogenetic approaches. The reference datasets are available in multiple formats from the project homepage, http://www.eukaryome.org.},

Climatic factors, followed by edaphic and spatial variables, constitute the best predictors of fungal richness and community composition at the global scale. Fungi show similar latitudinal diversity gradients to other organisms, with several notable exceptions.

  abstract = {Molecular identification methods, in particular high-throughput sequencing tools, have greatly improved our knowledge about fungal diversity and biogeography, but many of the recovered taxa from natural environments cannot be identified to species or even higher taxonomic levels. This study addresses the phylogenetic placement of previously unrecognized fungal groups by using two complementary approaches: (i) third-generation amplicon sequencing analysis of DNA from global soil samples, screening out ITS reads of\,{$<$}\,90\% similarity to other available Sanger sequences, and (ii) analysis of common fungal taxa that were previously indicated to be enigmatic in terms of taxonomic placement based on the ITS sequences alone (so-called top50 sequences). For the global soil samples, we chose to amplify the full rRNA gene operon using four partly overlapping amplicons and multiple newly developed primers or primer combinations that cover nearly all fungi and a vast majority of non-fungal eukaryotes. We extracted the rRNA 18S (SSU) and 28S (LSU) genes and performed phylogenetic analyses against carefully selected reference material. Both SSU and LSU analyses placed most soil sequences and top50 sequences to known orders and classes, but tens of monophyletic groups and single sequences remained outside described taxa. Furthermore, the LSU analyses recovered a few small groups of sequences that may potentially represent novel phyla. We conclude that rRNA genes-based phylogenetic analyses are efficient tools for determining phylogenetic relationships of fungal taxa that cannot be placed to any order or class using ITS sequences alone. However, in many instances, longer rRNA gene sequences and availability of both SSU and LSU reads are needed to improve taxonomic resolution. By leveraging third-generation sequencing from global soil samples, we successfully provided phylogenetic placement for many previously unidentified sequences and broadened our view on the fungal tree of life, with 10–20\% new order-level taxa. In addition, the PacBio sequence data greatly extends fungal class-level information in reference databases.},

In Patagonia, the ECM tree Nothofagus pumilio forms monospecific forests along mountain slopes without confounding effects of vegetation on plant–fungi interactions. To determine how fungal diversity and function are linked to elevation, we characterized fungal communities, edaphic variables, and eight extracellular enzyme activities along six elevation transects in Tierra del Fuego (Argentina and Chile). We also tested whether pairing ITS1 rDNA Illumina sequences generated taxonomic biases related to sequence length. Fungal community shifts across elevations were mediated primarily by soil pH with the most species-rich fungal families occurring mostly within a narrow pH range. By contrast, enzyme activities were minimally influenced by elevation but correlated with soil factors, especially total soil carbon. The activity of leucine aminopeptidase was positively correlated with ECM fungal richness and abundance, and acid phosphatase was correlated with nonECM fungal abundance. Several fungal lineages were undetected when using exclusively paired or unpaired forward ITS1 sequences, and these taxonomic biases need reconsideration for future studies. Our results suggest that soil fungi in N. pumilio forests are functionally similar across elevations and that these diverse communities help to maintain nutrient mobilization across the elevation gradient.},

  abstract = {Dietary and predator–prey studies are more frequently relying on DNA metabarcoding methods, typically achieving results that have a better taxonomic resolution (e.g., species-level) than previous methods. With the continuous advancement in sequencing technology, what was previously accessible only as a large, fixed structure in a laboratory, which had a limited number of users, has now advanced to a small and readily usable device. In this study, we used the gut (content and lining) from juvenile lanternfish (Hygophum) specimens to compare the short-read sequencing capability of the portable Nanopore MinION with the Illumina MiSeq. Primers common in dietary DNA metabarcoding work (COI “Leray primers” and 18S rRNA V4 “Zhan primers”) were used, with an additional comparison of cost-effective COI “Lobo primers” (targeting the same COI fragment) for the proficiency in species detection of a broad range of taxa. Our results indicate high congruency between sequencing machines for, not only taxonomic assignments, but also relative read abundance of the main dietary items. We also identified that Nanopore sequencing is more cost-effective. The Lobo primers are comparable to that of Leray, but substantially reduce the primer set price without compromising detection of taxa. Using both COI and 18S broadened the taxonomic scope, providing greater prey detection. Overall, this preliminary study was successful in creating a foundation for future dietary work involving larvae and transformation stage fishes whereby the content of the gut need not be separated from the gut lining to detect prey. The Hygophum diet detected here aligns with previous research that suggests the main dietary items to be calanoid copepods, but using molecular methods, soft prey was more readily identified compared to studies using visual methods of identification of dietary items. Overall, this study found that Nanopore sequencing is suitable for short-read DNA metabarcoding and can provide rapid access to sequencing results.},

  abstract = {Although the commonly used internal transcribed spacer region of rDNA (ITS) is well suited for taxonomic identification of fungi, the information on the relative abundance of taxa and diversity is negatively affected by the multicopy nature of rDNA and the existence of ITS paralogues. Moreover, due to high variability, ITS sequences cannot be used for phylogenetic analyses of unrelated taxa. The part of single-copy gene encoding the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (rpb2) was thus compared with first spacer of ITS as an alternative marker for the analysis of fungal communities in spruce forest topsoil, and their applicability was tested on a comprehensive mock community. In soil, rpb2 exhibited broad taxonomic coverage of the entire fungal tree of life including basal fungal lineages. The gene exhibited sufficient variation for the use in phylogenetic analyses and taxonomic assignments, although it amplifies also paralogues. The fungal taxon spectra obtained with rbp2 region and ITS1 corresponded, but sequence abundance differed widely, especially in the basal lineages. The proportions of OTU counts and read counts of major fungal groups were close to the reality when rpb2 was used as a molecular marker while they were strongly biased towards the Basidiomycota when using the ITS primers ITS1/ITS4. Although the taxonomic placement of rbp2 sequences is currently more difficult than that of the ITS sequences, its discriminative power, quantitative representation of community composition and suitability for phylogenetic analyses represent significant advantages.},

  abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are crucial mutualistic symbionts of the majority of plant species, with essential roles in plant nutrient uptake and stress mitigation. The importance of AM fungi in ecosystems contrasts with our limited understanding of the patterns of AM fungal biogeography and the environmental factors that drive those patterns. This article presents a release of a newly developed global AM fungal dataset (GlobalAMFungi database, https://globalamfungi.com) that aims to reduce this knowledge gap. It contains almost 50 million observations of Glomeromycotinian AM fungal amplicon DNA sequences across almost 8500 samples with geographical locations and additional metadata obtained from 100 original studies. The GlobalAMFungi database is built on sequencing data originating from AM fungal taxon barcoding regions in: i) the small subunit rRNA (SSU) gene; ii) the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region; and iii) the large subunit rRNA (LSU) gene. The GlobalAMFungi database is an open source and open access initiative that compiles the most comprehensive atlas of AM fungal distribution. It is designed as a permanent effort that will be continuously updated by its creators and through the collaboration of the scientific community. This study also documented applicability of the dataset to better understand ecology of AM fungal taxa.},

We assess the deep neural network approach for fungal sequence classification as it has emerged as a successful paradigm for big data classification and clustering. Two deep learning-based classifiers, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a deep belief network (DBN) were trained using our recently released barcode datasets. Experimental results show that CNN outperformed the traditional BLAST classification and the most accurate machine learning based Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) classifier on datasets that had many of the labels present in the training datasets. When classifying an independent dataset namely the “Top 50 Most Wanted Fungi”, CNN and DBN assigned less sequences than BLAST. However, they could assign much more sequences than the RDP classifier. In terms of efficiency, it took the machine learning classifiers up to two seconds to classify a test dataset while it was 53~s for BLAST. The result of the current study will enable us to speed up the taxonomic assignments for the fungal barcode sequences generated at our institute as \textasciitilde\,70\% of them still need to be validated for public release. In addition, it will help to quickly provide a taxonomic profile for metagenomics samples.},

  abstract = {The accuracy and precision of fungal molecular identification and classification are challenging, particularly in environmental metabarcoding approaches as these often trade accuracy for efficiency given the large data volumes at hand. In most ecological studies, only a single similarity cutoff value is used for sequence identification. This is not sufficient since the most commonly used DNA markers are known to vary widely in terms of inter- and intraspecific variability. We address this problem by presenting a new tool, dnabarcoder, to predict local similarity cutoffs and measure the resolving powers of a biomarker for sequence identification for different clades of fungi. It was shown that the predicted similarity cutoffs varied significantly between the clades of a recently released ITS DNA barcode data set from the CBS culture collection of the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. When classifying a large public fungal ITS data set—the UNITE database—against the barcode data set, the local similarity cutoffs assigned fewer sequences than the traditional cutoffs used in metabarcoding studies. However, the obtained accuracy and precision were significantly improved. Our study showed that it might be better to extract the ITS region from the ITS barcodes to optimize taxonomic assignment accuracy. Furthermore, 15.3, 25.6, and 26.3\% of the fungal species of the barcode data set were indistinguishable by full-length ITS, ITS1, and ITS2, respectively. Except for these indistinguishable species, the resolving powers of full-length ITS, ITS1, and ITS2 sequences were similar at the species level. Nevertheless, the complete ITS region had a better resolving power at higher taxonomic levels.},

Sequences of two loci, ITS and LSU, were generated as barcode data for all (ca. 9k) yeast strains included in the CBS collection, originally assigned to ca. 2\hphantom{,}000 species. Taxonomic sequence validation turned out to be the most severe bottleneck due to the large volume of generated trace files and lack of reference sequences. We have analysed and validated CBS strains and barcode sequences automatically. Our analysis shows that there were 6 and 9.5~\% of CBS yeast species that could not be distinguished by ITS and LSU, respectively. Among them, ∼3~\% were indistinguishable by both loci. Except for those species, both loci were successfully resolving yeast species as the grouping of yeast DNA barcodes with the predicted taxonomic thresholds was more than 90~\% similar to the grouping with respect to the expected taxon names. The taxonomic thresholds predicted to discriminate yeast species were 98.41~\% for ITS and 99.51~\% for LSU. To discriminate current yeast genera, thresholds were 96.31~\% for ITS and 97.11~\% for LSU. Using ITS and LSU barcodes, we were also able to show that the recent reclassifications of basidiomycetous yeasts in 2015 have made a significant improvement for the generic taxonomy of those organisms. The barcodes of 4\hphantom{,}730 (51~\%) CBS yeast strains of 1\hphantom{,}351 (80~\%) accepted yeast species that were manually validated have been released to GenBank and the CBS-KNAW website as reference sequences for yeast identification.},

Microbial Biological Resource Centres are a rich source for diverse and high-quality reference materials in microbiology, and yet the strains preserved in these biobanks have been exploited only on a limited scale to generate DNA barcodes. As part of a project funded in the Netherlands to barcode specimens of major national biobanks, sequences of two nuclear ribosomal genetic markers, the Internal Transcribed Spaces and 5.8S gene (ITS) and the D1/D2 domain of the 26S Large Subunit (LSU), were generated as DNA barcode data for ca. 100\hphantom{,}000 fungal strains originally assigned to ca. 17\hphantom{,}000 species in the CBS fungal biobank maintained at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute, Utrecht. Using more than 24\hphantom{,}000 DNA barcode sequences of 12\hphantom{,}000 ex-type and manually validated filamentous fungal strains of 7\hphantom{,}300 accepted species, the optimal identity thresholds to discriminate filamentous fungal species were predicted as 99.6~\% for ITS and 99.8~\% for LSU. We showed that 17~\% and 18~\% of the species could not be discriminated by the ITS and LSU genetic markers, respectively. Among them, ∼8~\% were indistinguishable using both genetic markers. ITS has been shown to outperform LSU in filamentous fungal species discrimination with a probability of correct identification of 82~\% vs. 77.6~\%, and a clustering quality value of 84~\% vs. 77.7~\%. At higher taxonomic classifications, LSU has been shown to have a better discriminatory power than ITS. With a clustering quality value of 80~\%, LSU outperformed ITS in identifying filamentous fungi at the ordinal level. At the generic level, the clustering quality values produced by both genetic markers were low, indicating the necessity for taxonomic revisions at genus level and, likely, for applying more conserved genetic markers or even whole genomes. The taxonomic thresholds predicted for filamentous fungal identification at the genus, family, order and class levels were 94.3~\%, 88.5~\%, 81.2~\% and 80.9~\% based on ITS barcodes, and 98.2~\%, 96.2~\%, 94.7~\% and 92.7~\% based on LSU barcodes. The DNA barcodes used in this study have been deposited to GenBank and will also be publicly available at the Westerdijk Institute's website as reference sequences for fungal identification, marking an unprecedented data release event in global fungal barcoding efforts to date.},

It provides taxonomic assignments from domain to genus, with confidence estimates for each assignment. The majority of classifications (98\%) were of high estimated confidence (≥95\%) and high accuracy (98\%). In addition to being tested with the corpus of 5,014 type strain sequences from Bergey's outline, the RDP Classifier was tested with a corpus of 23,095 rRNA sequences as assigned by the NCBI into their alternative higher-order taxonomy. The results from leave-one-out testing on both corpora show that the overall accuracies at all levels of confidence for near-full-length and 400-base segments were 89\% or above down to the genus level, and the majority of the classification errors appear to be due to anomalies in the current taxonomies. For shorter rRNA segments, such as those that might be generated by pyrosequencing, the error rate varied greatly over the length of the 16S rRNA gene, with segments around the V2 and V4 variable regions giving the lowest error rates. The RDP Classifier is suitable both for the analysis of single rRNA sequences and for the analysis of libraries of thousands of sequences. Another related tool, RDP Library Compare, was developed to facilitate microbial-community comparison based on 16S rRNA gene sequence libraries. It combines the RDP Classifier with a statistical test to flag taxa differentially represented between samples.

Here, we examine the performance of different basecalling tools, looking at accuracy at the level of bases within individual reads and at majority-rule consensus basecalls in an assembly. We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling: training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly by additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish. Results: Training basecallers on taxon-specific data results in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network is able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences ('polishing') with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but pre-polish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy. Conclusions: Basecalling accuracy has seen significant improvements over the last 2 years. The current version of ONT's Guppy basecaller performs well overall, with good accuracy and fast performance. If higher accuracy is required, users should consider producing a custom model using a larger neural network and/or training data from the same species.},

However, only limited studies evaluate the combined effect of nutrients availability and soil disturbance on the soil bacteria community structure, especially in conventional agricultural practices, on the forests converted to agricultural land. This study aimed to provide a viewpoint of the effect of different soil management systems, i.e., forest soil (natural process) and tilled land, on soil bacteria community structure on forest converted to agricultural land, according to a metagenomics approach. Moreover, each land use was sampled to identify the bacterial community using 16S gene as a biomarker. The sequencing was performed using MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to read the DNA sequence from each soil sample. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to comprehend the relationship between availability of nutrients and bacterial diversity. The results revealed that the concentrations of soil micronutrients, such as iron, zinc, and magnesium, were significantly higher in forest soil than in tilled land. According to diversity indices, soil bacteria were more diverse in forest soil than in tilled land. Forest soil had more distinctive taxa than tilled land. Several species comprised the most abundant taxa, such as Candidatus Koribacter versatilis, Candidatus Solibacter usiatus, Rhodoplanes sp., Luteitalea pratensis, and Betaproteobacteria bacterium, were more scarce in tilled land. On the distinctive taxa in each soil sample, Anseongella ginsenosidimutans and Janthinobacterium sp. were the most abundant species in forest and tilled land, respectively. According to PCA analysis, soil management system affected the soil micro-and macronutrients also microbial community structure between forest and tilled land. In conclusion, soil management influences the essential nutrient content and bacterial community structure of soil. Better management should be adopted to maintain soil quality near forest soil},

  abstract = {Even though each of us shares more than 99\% of the DNA sequences in our genome, there are millions of sequence codes or structure in small regions that differ between individuals, giving us different characteristics of appearance or responsiveness to medical treatments. Currently, genetic variants in diseased tissues, such as tumors, are uncovered by exploring the differences between the reference genome and the sequences detected in the diseased tissue. However, the public reference genome was derived with the DNA from multiple individuals. As a result of this, the reference genome is incomplete and may misrepresent the sequence variants of the general population. The more reliable solution is to compare sequences of diseased tissue with its own genome sequence derived from tissue in a normal state. As the price to sequence the human genome has dropped dramatically to around \$1000, it shows a promising future of documenting the personal genome for every individual. However, de novo assembly of individual genomes at an affordable cost is still challenging. Thus, till now, only a few human genomes have been fully assembled. In this review, we introduce the history of human genome sequencing and the evolution of sequencing platforms, from Sanger sequencing to emerging "third generation sequencing" technologies. We present the currently available de novo assembly and post-assembly software packages for human genome assembly and their requirements for computational infrastructures. We recommend that a combined hybrid assembly with long and short reads would be a promising way to generate good quality human genome assemblies and specify parameters for the quality assessment of assembly outcomes. We provide a perspective view of the benefit of using personal genomes as references and suggestions for obtaining a quality personal genome. Finally, we discuss the usage of the personal genome in aiding vaccine design and development, monitoring host immune-response, tailoring drug therapy and detecting tumors. We believe the precision medicine would largely benefit from bioinformatics solutions, particularly for personal genome assembly.},

  abstract = {Biological invasion is a long process that starts with humans introducing intentionally (most of the time) species into a new environment to benefit from the ecosystem services that these species provide. Increasing evidence suggests that species providing ecosystem services might be phylogenetically closer than expected, but only a few studies actually demonstrate this. Also, recent studies indicate that naturalized and invasive species are two functionally distinct groups, but evidence that they are also two phylogenetically distinct groups is mixed. Using the set of Australian Acacia species known to have been introduced intentionally by humans to several parts of the world for the ecosystem services they provide, we first tested whether there is a phylogenetic pattern in the subset of introduced species. We found that species moved beyond Australia are phylogenetically more closely related than expected at random, suggesting that the ecosystem services that guide human-mediated introduction of these species into new areas (e.g. famine food, medicines, fuel, fodder, ornament) may be shared between closely related species. We also found that naturalized non-invasive and naturalized invasive species are closely related and both are not a phylogenetically random subset of introduced species based on mean phylogenetic distance, suggesting that naturalization and invasion processes may be phylogenetically mediated. Collectively, our study indicates that phylogeny might play different roles at different stages of the biological invasion process.},

  abstract = {The long-read amplicon provides a species-level solution for the community. With the improvement of nanopore flowcells, the accuracy of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) R10.4.1 has been substantially enhanced, with an average of approximately 99\%. To evaluate its effectiveness on amplicons, three types of microbiomes were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA (hereinafter referred to as “16S”) amplicon sequencing using Novaseq, Pacbio sequel II, and Nanopore PromethION platforms (R9.4.1 and R10.4.1) in the current study. We showed the error rate, recall, precision, and bias index in the mock sample. The error rate of ONT R10.4.1 was greatly reduced, with a better recall in the case of the synthetic community. Meanwhile, in different types of environmental samples, ONT R10.4.1 analysis resulted in a composition similar to Pacbio data. We found that classification tools and databases influence ONT data. Based on these results, we conclude that the ONT R10.4.1 16S amplicon can also be used for application in environmental samples. The long-read amplicon supplies the community with a species-level solution. Due to the high error rate of nanopore sequencing early on, it has not been frequently used in 16S studies. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) introduced the R10.4.1 flowcell with Q20+ reagent to achieve more than 99\% accuracy as sequencing technology advanced. However, there has been no published study on the performance of commercial PromethION sequencers with R10.4.1 flowcells on 16S sequencing or on the impact of accuracy improvement on taxonomy (R9.4.1 to R10.4.1) using 16S ONT data. In this study, three types of microbiomes were investigated by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing using Novaseq, Pacbio sequel II, and Nanopore PromethION platforms (R9.4.1 and R10.4.1). In the mock sample, we displayed the error rate, recall, precision, and bias index. We observed that the error rate in ONT R10.4.1 is significantly lower, especially when deletions are involved. First and foremost, R10.4.1 and Pacific Bioscience platforms reveal a similar microbiome in environmental samples. This study shows that the R10.4.1 full-length 16S rRNA sequences allow for species identification of environmental microbiota.}

  abstract = {Culture-independent analysis of microbial communities frequently relies on amplification and sequencing of the prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Typical analysis pipelines group sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to infer taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships. Here, we present HmmUFOtu, a novel tool for processing microbiome amplicon sequencing data, which performs rapid per-read phylogenetic placement, followed by phylogenetically informed clustering into OTUs and taxonomy assignment. Compared to standard pipelines, HmmUFOtu more accurately and reliably recapitulates microbial community diversity and composition in simulated and real datasets without relying on heuristics or sacrificing speed or accuracy.},
