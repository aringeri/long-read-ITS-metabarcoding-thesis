- QC approach
  - limitations of primer trimming
    - my method is stringent as it requires FWD and REV. This could cause bias in a real world scenario

- Limitations of assessing correct taxonomic assignments
  - taxonomic labels not always consistent in reference DB

- Recommendations
  - best practices for running
    - minimum sample sizes for recovering rare species
