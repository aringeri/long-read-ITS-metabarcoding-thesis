- QC approach
  - limitations of primer trimming
    - my method is stringent as it requires FWD and REV. This could cause bias in a real world scenario
    - make this configurable in pipeline for users

- measures of species recovery
  - \# otus vs. # species vs. %loss
  - nanoclust looks like it like it is recovering species when min_cluster_size is high, but actually clumping unrelated taxa together.
  - nanoclust read loss + # OTUs inconsistent at larger library sizes
  - Future:
    - nanoclust might still be useful, but more complicated
      - closer study of UMAP/HDBSCAN parameters and effect on ITS clustering

- Limitations of assessing correct taxonomic assignments
  - taxonomic labels not always consistent in reference DB

- At low min_cluster_size:
  - Nanoclust successful at delineating species that VSEARCH at 97% could not

- Taxonomic classification precision
  - surprisingly:
    - Nanoclust: lower unclassified and higher precision with lowest minimum OTU size
    - VSEARCH: lower classification rate when filtering small OTUs
    - consensus: introducing noise in nanoclust
      - poor performance for vsearch (explained by grouping unrelated species together)
      - future: determine source: racon or medaka?
        - explore better techniques (draft read, etc)

- Recommendations
  - best practices for running
    - minimum sample sizes for recovering rare species

- Future work
  - taking advantage of long read (LSU, SSU)
