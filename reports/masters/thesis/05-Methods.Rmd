## Preparation of reads from fungal isolates for mock scenarios

In order to understand the behaviour of our pipeline under different sampling scenarios, a mock dataset has been created using sequencing data from 65 known fungal isolates.
By mixing reads from different fungal isolates, we have simulated data that might be encountered when sampling from a complex fungal community.
As input to the pipeline, we passed a mock sample where the relative proportion of reads from each fungal isolate has been controlled.

We explored two patterns of mock sample generation: even abundance and uneven abundance.
Even abundance scenarios are where all fungal isolates in the mock sample have the same relative abundance in terms of read count.
While an uneven scenario is where a subset of fungal isolates in the mock sample have either a much lower abundance or much higher abundance relative to the other isolates.

@tbl-samplesheet provides the list of fungal species and the number of raw reads that were available to us for generating these mock scenarios.
The steps to generate and prepare reads for this synthetic dataset are outlined below.

### DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing

The genomic DNA of 65 fungal strains was extracted with the Qiagen DNeasy Plant mini kit.
The DNA was extracted from mycelia or spore material of each fungal isolate.
Partial SSU, full ITS region and partial LSU regions of each sample were amplified with primers NS5 (forward) and LR6 (reverse).
The amplicons were prepared with the Oxford Nanopore's Native Barcoding Kit 96 V14 (code SQK-NBD114.96, ONT).
The fungal samples plus a negative control were multiplexed and sequenced using the MinION R10.4 flow cell.

### Bioinformatics - Basecalling, trimming and filtering

The raw ONT data was basecalled and demultiplexed using Guppy v6.4.2 with the super-high accuracy model (dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup).
The mean read length of amplicons after basecalling was ~2.2 KB as seen in @fig-rawReadQuality.

Sequencing adapters were trimmed from raw basecalled reads using Dorado v0.6.1 with the '`--no-trim-primers`' option to avoid removing primer sequences.
Cutadapt v4.6 [@Cutadapt] has been used to select and trim primers from amplicons that contain both forward (NS5) and reverse primer (LR6) sequences.
Amplicons where both of these primer sequences could not be detected were excluded from the analysis.
Cutadapt was also used to re-orient reads that have been sequenced by the reverse strand ('`--revcomp`' option), making it easier to process by downstream tools (@fig-filterTrimFlowchart)

The full ITS region of these reads was extracted using ITSxpress v2.0.1 [@Rivers2018] with default settings other than '`--single_end`' and '`--taxa Fungi`' options.
Chopper v0.7.0 [@DeCoster2023] was used to select reads of the full ITS region having a length between 300-6000bp and mean Phred quality score above Q20.
Chimeric reads were detected using VSEARCH's [@rognesVSEARCHVersatileOpen2016] denovo and reference based methods.
The database used for reference based chimera detection of full ITS sequence was the UNITE+INSD 2024 reference database [@abarenkovFullUNITEINSDDataset2024; @vu_2024_12580255]

Quality Filtering of Raw Reads

### Sample selection and taxonomic naming validation

To ensure that taxonomic names were used consistently between the fungal isolate samples and the reference database, manual validation of each sample name was performed.
A search was conducted for the recorded species name of each sample in the 2024 UNITE+INSD reference database [@abarenkovFullUNITEINSDDataset2024; @vu_2024_12580255].
Most species names that could not be found were either misspelled or used an older taxonomic synonym.
For example, *Nakaseomyces glabratus* has been recorded by its former name *Candida glabrata* which the latter could not be found in the reference database.
Names of samples were manually updated using current names found in both Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org) and the 2024 UNITE reference database.
For samples that were not classified at the species level (e.g. *Entoleuca sp* CCL052), the genus label was confirmed to exist in the reference database.

Seven samples were excluded from the mock dataset, leaving 58 samples (a total of 55 species).
Six samples that had less than a total of 2500 reads after basecalling, trimming and filtering were removed from the analysis leaving.
This limit of 2500 reads was chosen in order to test scenarios with library sizes of up to 150000 reads.
With this limit we could also retain the majority of the samples (see @fig-readCountDistributionBySample for the distribution of read counts per sample, and @tbl-samplesheet for read counts).

Initial runs of the pipeline used the 2019 version of the UNITE database for reference-based chimera detection.
The use of this database for chimera detection lead to the loss of 99.0% of reads in the *Fusarium proliferatum* sample and the sample was therefore excluded from the mock dataset.
At a later date, the pipeline was updated to use the 2024 version of the UNITE database which retained many more reads (total of 4894) from the *F. proliferatum* sample
but the pipeline was still configured to exclude the *F. proliferatum* sample.

The list of excluded taxa include: *Aspergillus niger*, *Naganishia albida* (*Cryptococcus albidus*), *Geotrichum candidum* (*Galactomyces geotrichum*), *Meyerozyma guilliermondii*, Yarrowia lipolytica, *Fusarium proliferatum* and *Puccinia recondita* (*Puccinia triticina*).

## Mock scenarios

After the raw reads from the fungal isolates had been processed as described above, we had a pool of high quality full ITS sequences which could be sampled from to simulate different community structures.
Here the steps taken to combine these full ITS sequences into mock scenarios are outlined below.
Two main approaches have been followed for simulating even and uneven species abundance.

### Scenario 1 - Even abundance

The first mock scenario simulated an even community structure where every fungal isolate has equal abundance in terms of number of reads.
Libraries of differing sizes were generated by subsampling equal number of reads from each fungal isolate.
For each of the 58 fungal isolates: 20, 50, 167, 1000, 2000 and 2500 reads were randomly selected to produce libraries with sizes of 1160, 2900, 9686, 58000, 116000 and 145000 reads (@fig-equalAbundanceDiagram).
Seqtk v1.4 [@Lh3SeqtkToolkit] was used to perform the subsampling (with the '`sample`' command).
The subsampling was repeated five times for each library size producing a total of 30 libraries (6 libraries $\times$ 5  repetitions).
The random seed values given to seqtk's '`sample`' command for each repetition were generated deterministically so that each run of the pipeline was reproducible.

### Scenario 2 - Uneven (5 low abundance)

As it is unlikely for a 'real world' environmental sample to produce sequence data resembling Scenario 1 where all strains have the same number of reads,
we explored limited situations where the number of reads between isolates was unequal.
For this scenario, a subset of 5 species were subsampled at low abundance, while a remaining 50 species were subsampled at an even abundance.
5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 reads were subsampled from the *Trichomonascus ciferrii*, *Erysiphe necator*, *Eutypa lata*, *Penicillium chrysogenum*, *Candida zeylanoides* samples respectively, then mixed with the evenly-subsampled reads from the other 50 species.

- removed duplicate species

## Bioinformatics - Clustering

For each scenario full ITS sequences were grouped into approximate species-level clusters.
Two de-novo clustering approaches were explored and can be seen in @fig-clusterAssignFlowchart.

The first approach uses centroid-based clustering on sequence similarity as implemented in VSEARCH [@rognesVSEARCHVersatileOpen2016].
The sequences were first de-replicated using VSEARCH's `'--fastx_uniques'` option to merge identical sequences into a single record, then clustered with the `'--cluster_size'` option.
97% identity was used as the pairwise sequence similarity threshold.
This clustering approach resulted in many low-abundance operational taxonomic units (OTUs).
Methods for selecting a threshold to remove low-abundance spurious OTUs is explored in @sec-cluster-results.

The second clustering approach grouped sequences by similarity of their k-mer signatures.
We followed the clustering approach used by the NanoCLUST tool [@rodriguez-perezNanoCLUSTSpecieslevelAnalysis2021; @langsiriTargetedSequencingAnalysis2023].
Each sequence was transformed into a k-mer frequency vector and stored in a tabular format.
In our pipeline, 6-mer frequencies were computed (as opposed to 5-mers in NanoCLUST).
The multidimensional tabular structure was then projected into two-dimensions using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) [@mcinnesUMAPUniformManifold2020].
Sequences (represented as points in the two-dimensional space) were then clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) [@mcinnes2017hdbscan].
The 'cluster_selection_epsilon' parameter used in HDBSCAN was set to 0.5 as used in [@langsiriTargetedSequencingAnalysis2023], while the multiple '`min_cluster_size`' parameters were tested and explored in @sec-cluster-results.t
For equal abundance scenarios a '`min_cluster_size`' parameter was chosen to be 0.5% of the total library size.
For uneven abundance scenarios (...) .

## Bioinformatics - Taxonomic assignments

A representative sequence was selected from each cluster to provide a taxonomic assignment.
Our initial approach used the most abundant sequence of each cluster as the representative sequence.
The VSEARCH clustering approach provides the most abundant sequences with the '`--centroids`' option.
To determine the most abundant sequence from clusters in the UMAP + HDBSCAN approach, the VSEARCH '`--fastx_uniques`' command in combination with '`--topn 1`' option was used.

Alternatively, a consensus sequence was built from the reads from each cluster following a similar approach used by nanoCLUST see @fig-clusterPolishFlow.
First a subset of 200 sequences was selected from each cluster to reduce computation time and space requirements.
Then a draft sequence was selected by taking the read with the highest Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) to all the other sequences with FastANI [@jainHighThroughputANI2018].
The 200 reads used for polishing were then aligned to the draft sequence using minimap2 v2.28 [@liMinimap2PairwiseAlignment2018].
Subsequently, the draft read underwent two rounds of polishing using Racon v1.5.0 [@vaserFastAccurateNovo2017] then Medaka v1.12.0 ([https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka](https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka)).
As Canu [@korenCanuScalableAccurate2017] is designed as a long-read assembler, it has a strict minimum genome size of 1000 making it unable to polish full ITS sequences from my dataset (which were around 400bp).

The representative sequence from each cluster was then given a taxonomic assignment with dnabarcoder v1.0.6 [@vuDnabarcoderOpensourceSoftware2022].
In this case full ITS sequences were classified against the UNITE+INSD 2024 reference database [@abarenkovFullUNITEINSDDataset2024; @vu_2024_12580255] using precomputed similarity cutoffs provided by the dnabarcoder project [@vuDnabarcoderOpensourceSoftware2022].

## Pipeline implementation

The pipeline has been implemented using the Nextflow workflow language [@ditommasoNextflowEnablesReproducible2017].
The pipeline has been developed to run Singularity [@kurtzerSingularityScientificContainers2017] or Docker [@merkel2014docker] containers and allows the pipeline to flexibly run
on all systems that support either one of these container systems.

As input, the pipeline takes a set of `fastq` files where each file contains the raw basecalled reads for each sample in the metabarcoding experiment.
