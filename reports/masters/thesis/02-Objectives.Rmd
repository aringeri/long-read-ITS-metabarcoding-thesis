The goal of this research project is to develop a bioinformatic workflow to characterise fungal communities from long-read ONT sequences.
As part of this higher-level goal, we aim to achieve the following:

1. Apply filtering and processing workflows which extract taxonomic informative regions from fungal long-read rDNA sequencing amplicons
2. Evaluate clustering and taxonomic assignment methods on extracted rDNA regions.
3. Assess established workflows (#1 and 2) on a mock fungal long-read rDNA dataset.
4. Apply developed workflows on a real world soil dataset.
5. Publish the workflow software that can serve others in their own analysis of ONT rDNA datasets.
