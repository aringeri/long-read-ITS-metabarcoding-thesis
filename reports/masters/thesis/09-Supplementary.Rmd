Chart showing how 58 fungal isolates are split into clusters based on a single execution of the even abundance mock scenario.
Each isolate has been subsampled to 2000 reads and then clustered using the NanoCLUST (UMAP + HDBSCAN) method with a minimum cluster size set to 580 (0.5% of the total library size).
Bars indicate the abundance of a cluster (number of reads). The taxonomic classification given by dnabarcoder (with the UNITE 2024 database) for each cluster is shown in the X axis labels. Green indicates that the assignment given to a cluster matches the expected species-level classification. Yellow indicates a correct genus-level classification.
Orange indicates a correct family-level classification. Red indicates the classification is incorrect for family-level and above.
Grey indicates that the cluster could not be given a taxonomic classification at all.
