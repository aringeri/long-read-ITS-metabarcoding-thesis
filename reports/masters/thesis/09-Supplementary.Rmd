Plot indicating the splitting of all samples into clusters using the UMAP + HDBSCAN method. Each plot shows how reads from each sample are distributed into clusters. Bars indicate the abundance of a cluster (number of reads). Taxonomic classification of each cluster is shown in the X axis labels. Green indicates that a cluster matches the expected species-level classification.
