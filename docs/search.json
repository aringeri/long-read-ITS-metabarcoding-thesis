    "section": "",
    "text": "Fungi form the third-largest kingdom of life and is estimated to contain between two and three million species (Niskanen et al., 2023). To date, approximately 161,000 species have been formally described (Index Fungorum Partnership, 2024). Fungi have diverse living forms, are widely distributed and take on numerous ecological roles in terrestrial and aquatic habitats (Peay et al., 2016; Phukhamsakda et al., 2022). Saprotrophic fungi break down organic matter and are involved in nutrient cycling, while others form mutually beneficial interactions with other species such as the formation of mycorrhiza between plants and fungi (Frey, 2019). Other fungi form pathogenic interactions causing considerable damage to human health and agriculture (Fisher et al., 2020).\nMetabarcoding is a technique for identifying the organisms that are present in an environment by sampling and analysing genomic content after amplification of DNA barcodes (Taberlet et al., 2018). Applications of metabarcoding include: the profiling of communities, analysis of diversity and inferring ecological patterns (Kisand et al., 2012; Corrales et al., 2021; Taberlet et al., 2018).\nFungi can be identified using morphological features of sporing (or asexual) structures or by isolating them in culture from the environment of interest (Tedersoo and Nilsson, 2016). The presence of reproductive structures is often brief and a vast number of fungal lineages (such as ectomycorrhizal fungi) are difficult to isolate in culture. DNA barcoding provides a solution to this problem by detecting the DNA of targeted organisms without direct observation (Hajibabaei et al., 2011).\nAdvances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has provided the capacity to identify many species from bulk environmental samples such as soil (Tedersoo et al., 2022). This procedure (metabarcoding) works by extracting the genomic DNA of all organisms within a sample, followed by the amplification of a barcode region of interest using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Lindahl et al., 2013). The amplified DNA is sequenced by a HTS platform such as Illumina, PacBio or Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Using computational techniques, sequences can be analysed and compared to those in reference databases to identify taxa. The accuracy of these taxonomic classifications depends heavily on the quality of the reference data used (Tedersoo et al., 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The main steps for a fungal metabarcoding workflow. Depicted is the nuclear ribosomal RNA operon where short-read technologies target the ITS1 or ITS2 subregion in isolation. Long-read technologies can target the entire ITS region and beyond (Nilsson et al., 2019)\n\n\n\nThe barcode region most commonly used for metabarcoding of fungi is the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region which is found between the 18S and 28S subunits of the nuclear ribosome, also known as the small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) respectively (Tedersoo et al., 2022). The ITS region has become the universal marker for barcoding fungi for multiple reasons. PCR amplification of the ITS marker has a high success rate due to highly conserved regions which flank the marker. This allows PCR primers can be designed to cover a high range of Fungi (Schoch et al., 2012). See Figure 1 for a general overview of fungal metabarcoding. As ITS regions are non-coding, they are highly variable and provide high inter- and intraspecies resolution (Schoch et al., 2012).\nHTS technologies have been adopted for metabarcoding due to large sequencing capacity and the ability to characterize DNA sequences from mixed samples as opposed to traditional methods such as Sanger sequencing (Nilsson et al., 2019). Short-read HTS methods such as Illumina MiSeq are commonly used for metabarcoding studies and allow for the sequencing of up to 2x300 (forward and reverse direction) basepairs (bp) per read (Tedersoo et al., 2022; Illumina Inc., 2023). In fungal metabarcoding, these read length limitations makes Illumina best suited to analyse the smaller ITS1 or ITS2 subregions separately with a very high sequencing depth (Nilsson et al., 2019). Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq and HiSeq produce a very high numbers of reads per run (up to 25 million, 1.2 billion and 6 billion respectively) that result in high quality denoised sequences (Illumina Inc., 2023, 2016).\nSequencing platforms such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and PacBio provide much longer read lengths compared to Illumina HTS methods. ONT sequencing is comparatively cheap and can be performed in a basic molecular lab or in the field (Mafune et al., 2020; Baloğlu et al., 2021). Until recently, the high error rate made ONT sequencing unsuitable for metabarcoding studies (Zhang et al., 2023). The prospect of long-read sequencing for fungal metabarcoding is that the longer reads will be able to cover multiple marker genes, including the full ribosomal operon, and can provide more reliable phylogenetic placement and discovery of new fungal lineages (Tedersoo et al., 2018).\nIn the existing research, studies have explored the use of ONT sequencing for metabarcoding of soil microbial community structure (Wiryawan et al., 2022), rapid pathogen detection (Hong et al., 2020; Ohta et al., 2023), and testing the use of ONT for metabarcoding of mock fungal communities (Baloğlu et al., 2021; Mafune et al., 2020; Langsiri et al., 2023). In this study, we integrated common approaches to fungal metabarcoding into a bioinformatic workflow with the focus on analysing ONT data. We validated our metabarcoding approach with mock fungal communities and tested the workflow on real environmental soil samples.\n\n\n\n\nBaloğlu,B. et al.

    "text": "1 Fungal barcode regions\nMolecular barcoding is a technique for identifying organisms using a unique DNA region (or barcode) that is common to the group of targeted organisms (Taberlet et al., 2018). The variability of a DNA sequence among species provides the ability to discriminate between taxa (Hebert et al., 2003). For an ideal molecular barcode, the interspecific variation is much higher than the intraspecific variation (Schoch et al., 2012). The difference between these variations is called the barcode gap (Puillandre et al., 2012). A barcode is optimal when the sequence is unique to one species and there is little variability of the barcode within that same species (Schoch et al., 2012).\nIn fungi, barcode regions most often used for species identification are those that encode the nuclear ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and more rarely from other regions that encode proteins (Schoch et al., 2012). The nuclear rRNA region contains the 18S small subunit (SSU), 5.8S and 28S large subunit (LSU) rRNA genes. These genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase I and two spacer regions (ITS1 and ITS2) found between the genes are removed through post-transcriptional modifications. The region covering the two spacers is referred to as the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and typically spans 500–700 bases but is highly variable among fungal groups (Figure 1, Nilsson, Anslan, et al. (2019)).\nDue to read length limitations of short-read sequencing platforms, generally only one of the ITS1 or ITS2 subregions (250-400 bases) are targeted for sequencing (Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019). The limitations of using the ITS1 or ITS2 subregions in isolation is that they have lower taxonomic resolution and universal PCR primer sites are less convenient than the full ITS region (Tedersoo et al., 2022, 2015).\nThe ITS region has limitations on its coverage of taxa and is unsuitable for some groups of fungi. For example some species in the Microsporidia group may lack the ITS region, and other orchid root symbionts (Tulasnellaceae) have mutations in primer sites (Tedersoo and Nilsson, 2016; Tedersoo et al., 2022). The arbuscular mycorrhizal Glomeromycota have highly variable copies of the ITS region, with up to 20% divergence in a single multinucleate spore (Schoch et al., 2012). For these reasons, metabarcoding studies targeting arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi commonly use SSU or LSU instead of ITS (Delavaux et al., 2022; Öpik et al., 2010). Other fungal genera such as Trichoderma and Fusarium lack variability, making the ITS region unsuitable to discriminate between species (Tedersoo et al., 2022).\nCopy numbers of the ITS region can vary between species and non-identical copies can co-exist within the same individual (Bradshaw et al., 2023). This can lead to amplification bias, inflating diversity in organisms with higher copy numbers (Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019). Despite these limitations, ITS has a much higher PCR amplification success rate compared to protein-coding genes such as RPB1, RPB2 and MCM7 and is therefore better suited for metabarcoding (Schoch et al., 2012).\nOther rDNA genes used as fungal barcodes are the 18S SSU and 28S LSU. Since they encode RNA involved in ribosome formation, these regions are highly conserved and there is often insufficient variation in the SSU and LSU regions to discriminate between many basidiomycete and ascomycete species (Schoch et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the SSU and LSU markers can be useful at higher taxonomic levels to resolve the evolutionary history of genera, families, order and class (Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019).",

    "section": "2 Sequencing methods",
    "text": "2 Sequencing methods\nMolecular identification strategies have had a significant impact on fungal ecology research and have allowed investigators to identify organisms by sequencing their DNA. Early molecular studies in the 1990s indicated that there were many unknown fungal species that could not be detected from sporing bodies, isolation in culture or other observable structures (Gardes and Bruns, 1996; Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019; Tedersoo and Nilsson, 2016).\nThe high throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies 454 pyrosequencing and IonTorrent emerged in the 2000s that allowed for automated sequencing of mixed samples, enabling the identification of tens to hundreds of taxa from multiple samples (Jumpponen and Jones, 2009). The rapid adoption of 454 pyrosequencing led to an influx of sequencing data and a boom of the fungal ecology field (Hibbett et al., 2009). The 454 pyrosequencing platform was primarily adopted for fungal ecology studies between 2008 and 2014 and was capable of producing 1.2 million reads with a length of up to 1000 bases (Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019). Drawbacks to the pyrosequencing technique were the high cost and difficulties in sequencing homopolymer-rich regions (Tedersoo and Nilsson, 2016). As of 2016, the production of 454 sequencers was discontinued (BioIT, 2013).\nIon Torrent technology produced similar quality results to 454 pyrosequencing at lower cost but was limited to shorter read lengths (400–600 bp) and complex library preparation protocols (Tedersoo and Nilsson, 2016). Due to these drawbacks, Ion Torrent was never broadly used in fungal ecology (Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019).\nThe next advance in sequencing which had wide adoption was Illumina MiSeq technology (Tedersoo and Nilsson, 2016). The Illumina MiSeq, (and more recently) NextSeq and NovaSeq platforms offer short paired-end reads of up to 300 bp in length. These platforms provide very high throughput and high quality sequences. MiSeq, NextSeq and NovaSeq can sequence up to 20, 360 and 6000 gigabase (GB) of read data respectively (Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019; Illumina Inc., 2023). Of the sequencing systems, Illumina can provide one of the highest read qualities with typical accuracy of 99.9% (Illumina Inc.). The use of paired end reads (on forward and reverse strands) can enable the coverage of a longer ~550 base region (Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019). For these reasons, the Illumina sequencing platforms are currently the standard for use in metabarcoding and metagenomics (Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019).\nRecent advances in sequencing technology have provided much longer reads and are capable of sequencing a single DNA molecule, as opposed to clusters of DNA molecules as in Illumina sequencing (Figure 2) (Eid et al., 2009; Aigrain, 2021). Until recently, the low read quality of these techniques has been a limitation for metabarcoding studies (Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Illumina sequencing process. DNA fragments hybridise and are fixed to the bottom of a nanowell. These fragments are amplified into a cluster of identical sequences. Fluorescent dye–labeled dNTPs are incorporated into a complementary DNA strand by a DNA-polymerase. Synthesis is paused after each dNTP is incorporated allowing the device to take an image of the flow cell. The colour of each cluster is used to identify the base (A, C, G or T) that was incorporated. The process is repeated in a step-wise manner and the signals from each cluster produce a read. Source: (Aigrain, 2021).\n\n\n\nThe PacBio HiFi sequencing platform can provide read lengths of 10–25 KB and improves error rates through circular sequencing which allows the same molecule to be sequenced repetitively (PacBio, 2023; Tedersoo and Nilsson, 2016). PacBio HiFi reads can reach a base call accuracy comparable to Illumina of 99.9% but the relatively high cost is a major drawback for its adoption (Aigrain, 2021; Murigneux et al., 2020).\nOxford Nanopore Technology’s (ONT) sequencing platform has gained much attention in recent years and has been observed to produce read lengths of up to 2.4MB (Payne et al., 2019). With the ONT platform, sequencing can be performed at a relatively low cost and is much more accessible than other platforms since it can be run from a laptop, even in the field (Mafune et al., 2020). Until recently, a large drawback of the ONT system was the high raw error rate which had been reported to range between 1% and up to 15% (Baloğlu et al., 2021; Rang et al., 2018). Techniques to improve accuracy are advancing with new sequencing chemistry and basecalling algorithms. ONT is now claiming a raw read accuracy rate of 99.75% with the latest chemistry (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, 2024a) which is comparable to Illumina MiSeq.\nONT sequencing works by threading a single strand of DNA (or RNA) through a pore with an internal diameter on the order of ~1.4nm to 2.4nm (Wang et al., 2021). The pore is situated on a charged membrane and allows ions to flow across the membrane. The sequencing of base pairs is made possible by analysing the change of electric current across the membrane as the DNA (or RNA) molecule is ratcheted through the pore (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Illustration of Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing. A double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule (or RNA–DNA hybrid) is first unwound with the help of a motor protein, then the negatively charged single-stranded DNA (or RNA) is ratcheted through the nanopore driven by the voltage. As nucleotides pass through the nanopore, the change in current is measured and is used to determine the corresponding nucleotide. Each channel is associated with an electrode on the sensor chip and is controlled and measured by the application-specific integration circuit (ASIC) (Wang et al., 2021)\n\n\n\nONT’s first product was the smartphone sized MinION, which was released in 2014 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, 2023). Improved versions of their nanopore and motor proteins have been iteratively released starting with version R6 (in 2014) and their latest being R10.4.1 (Wang et al., 2021; Oxford Nanopore Technologies, 2024b). It is worth noting that none of the specifications for the proteins used in these systems have been fully disclosed by ONT (Wang et al., 2021).\nBasecalling is the process where raw electrical signals from the device are analysed to determine the sequence of nucleotides. The electrical signal is influenced by the nucleotides that occupy the pore at a given time. Historically, basecallers used hidden markov models (HMMs) to infer a DNA sequence from an electrical signal but modern basecallers now adopt neural networks and accuracy has improved significantly with each iteration (Wick et al., 2019; Rang et al., 2018). ONT’s latest basecaller is dorado which is: open source, optimised for graphics processing units (GPUs) and replaces ONT’s previous (now unsupported) basecaller guppy (Nanoporetech/dorado, 2024).",

    "text": "3 Bioinformatic analysis\nHere we will outline the key computational steps common to many metabarcoding analyses as outlined in Figure 1.\n\n3.1 Quality filtering\nQuality filtering is an initial step in a metabarcoding pipeline that processes the raw output of the sequencing instrument for further analysis and involves: demultiplexing, trimming of primer and index sequences, and removal of low quality and off target reads (Tedersoo et al., 2022).\nMultiplexing is a method for reducing costs by sequencing multiple DNA samples simultaneously, where each sequence contains a tag (or barcode) that is unique to the sample it belongs to (Wick et al., 2018). Demultiplexing is the process of splitting reads by these tags to determine which sample the read came from (Wick et al., 2018). The ONT basecallers dorado and guppy have built-in support for demultiplexing, while minibar (California Academy of Sciences, 2024) is suitable for custom barcoding schemes. Historically, custom tools such as Porechop (Wick) were developed to trim ONT sequencing adapters from reads, but currently this functionality is supported by dorado.\nFor ITS metabarcoding, it is useful to remove the genes flanking the ITS1 and ITS2 subregions (such as 18S, 5.8S and 22S) as they are more conserved and do not enhance species level resolution (Nilsson, Anslan, et al., 2019; Tedersoo et al., 2022). The tools ITSx (Bengtsson-Palme et al., 2013) and ITSxpress (Rivers et al., 2018) are capable of extracting ITS1, ITS2 and full length ITS regions using hidden markov models. ITSxpress expands on the functionality of ITSx, targeting its use for amplicon sequence variant (ASV) techniques over OTU clustering (Rivers et al., 2018).\nTo ensure the sequence data is usable for downstream analysis, quality filtering tools remove entire reads that do not meet a quality threshold or trim low quality segments from reads (Taberlet et al., 2018; Hakimzadeh et al., 2023). Some considerations are needed when performing quality filtering for ONT data. Tools such as NanoFilt (De Coster et al., 2018) and Chopper (De Coster and Rademakers, 2023) accept or reject an entire read based on an average quality score threshold. For ONT reads with variable quality, stretches of the read with high sequence quality may still be salvaged using Prowler (Lee et al., 2021) or Filtlong (Wick).\n\n\n\n3.2 Clustering\nIn general, clustering is an unsupervised technique for grouping items together based on their similarity to each other. In the context of metabarcoding, clustering is the process of aggregating DNA sequences into groups based on a predefined similarity metric.\nIn metabarcoding, a commonly used similarity metric is sequence identity and is defined as the proportion of nucleotides that match exactly between two sequences. Sequences are considered to be in the same cluster when the pairwise sequence identity is above a predefined threshold. The resulting clusters are called Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) (Cline et al., 2017; Blaxter et al., 2005). For fungal metabarcoding, sequence identity thresholds of OTUs usually range from 95% to 100%, most often delineating species at 97% (Tedersoo et al., 2022; Joos et al., 2020). Three types of clustering frequently seen in metabarcoding are: closed reference, de novo and open reference clustering (Tedersoo et al., 2022; Cline et al., 2017).\nClosed reference clustering is a method where OTUs are constructed based on similarity to sequences in a reference database (Cline et al., 2017). As a drawback, the biological variation that is not represented in the reference database is lost when clustering with this method (Callahan et al., 2017). Closed reference clustering allows OTUs to be tracked across studies provided the same reference database is used (Cline et al., 2017; Callahan et al., 2017).\nDe novo clustering is a commonly used method for defining fungal OTUs where sequences within an experimental dataset are clustered without relying on a reference database (Cline et al., 2017). The OTUs generated by de novo clustering are dependent on the dataset in which they are defined. Therefore, de novo OTUs clustered from different datasets cannot be reliably compared (Callahan et al., 2017). Compared with closed reference clustering, de novo clustering produces less stable OTUs but can detect biological variation that is not present in a reference database (He et al., 2015).\nOpen reference clustering combines the benefits of closed reference and de novo methods. Sequences are first clustered based on similarity to those in a reference database followed by de novo clustering of the unassigned sequences (Cline et al., 2017).\nThe amplicon sequence variant (ASV, also called the exact sequence variant) approach differs significantly from traditional OTU clustering by aiming to correct errors in reads then grouping identical reads together. ASV methods discriminate biological sequences from errors on the expectation that errors are rare (Callahan et al., 2017). ASV methods can detect small biological sequence variants, such as infraspecific variation (i.e. between populations within a species), while disregarding errors introduced through sequencing or library preparation, therefore increasing the taxonomic resolution of the results (Joos et al., 2020; Glassman and Martiny, 2018). Compared to OTU clustering where identity thresholds are defined artificially, ASVs have the advantage to be more precise and reproducible (Callahan et al., 2017). ASVs are largely used in metabarcoding studies targeting conserved regions such as the bacterial 16S. However, in fungal metabarcoding, ASVs are expected to perform poorly for groups that have multiple ITS copies and variants within individuals (Tedersoo et al., 2022). Therefore, ASV approaches tend to overestimate richness of common fungal species (due to haplotype variation) and underestimate richness of rare species (by removing rare variants) (Tedersoo et al., 2022; Joos et al., 2020). Nevertheless, when analysing diversity patterns based on dominant members of fungal communities, results are usually similar between ASV and OTU based approaches (Glassman and Martiny, 2018).\nA completely different approach to clustering has been implemented in the NanoCLUST pipeline (Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2021) which groups sequences by k-mer signature similarity. First, each sequence is transformed into a k-mer frequency vector and stored in a tabular format (one column per k-mer). A dimension reduction step converts the multidimensional tabular structure into two dimensions using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (McInnes et al., 2020). The similarity of sequences is represented as distances between points in two-dimensional space. The Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm is then used to cluster these points (Figure 4, McInnes et al. (2017)). HDBSCAN is a dynamic clustering approach that takes into consideration the density surrounding points which allows it to detect and remove noise. HDBSCAN requires setting a minimum cluster size parameter (min_cluster_size) which controls the minimum number points that are required to be considered a cluster. The parameter has the effect of filtering out small clusters or merging nearby clusters together (Leland McInnes et al., 2016). NanoCLUST has been developed for the analysis of 16S rRNA amplicons but other researchers have had success applying the same approach to fungal ITS sequences (Langsiri et al., 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of clustering with NanoCLUST. Reads are transformed into a k-mer frequency vector and stored in a tabular format. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is applied to reduce the multidimensional tabular structure into two dimensions. The Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm clusters points in two-dimensional space. Adapted from: (Langsiri et al., 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Taxonomic assignment\nIn fungal metabarcoding, taxonomic assignment is the process of classifying sequences to species or higher taxonomic ranks (Taberlet et al., 2018). If the sequences have been clustered into OTUs, a representative sequence from each OTU is used for the classification (Tedersoo et al., 2022). Sequences can also be given a taxonomic assignment directly without clustering (Klaubauf et al., 2010; Nygaard et al., 2020).\nThe quality of the taxonomic assignment depends on the reference database and algorithm used (Furneaux et al., 2021). Public INSDC databases such as GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank) are problematic for taxonomic assignment as a significant number of entries are incorrectly identified at the species level (Nilsson et al., 2006; Bidartondo, 2008).  Curated databases such as UNITE (Kõljalg et al., 2005) address this problem by maintaining high quality reference records of ITS sequences and curating taxonomic designation by researchers well versed in the taxonomic groups (Abarenkov et al., 2010). Similarly, the Ribosomal Data Project (RDP) (Cole et al., 2014) provides curated fungal LSU sequences while Silva (Quast et al., 2013) provides both SSU and LSU reference sequences. A drawback of curated databases is that they have limited taxonomic coverage and do not always include the most recently published sequences (Furneaux et al., 2021).\nA common method for taxonomic assignment is a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search (Camacho et al., 2009), where pairwise comparisons are made between representative sequences and those in a reference database to assign the closest matching reference (Taberlet et al., 2018; Tedersoo et al., 2022). The BLAST algorithm can massively reduce search space by scanning a database of sequences for small, fixed size subsequences (knows as words). These matching sites are used as starting points to initiate more in-depth alignment. Fixed BLAST percent identity cutoffs have often been used to classify sequences at a given taxonomic rank (i.e. 98%, 90% and 85% sequence identity to assign species, genus and family (Tedersoo et al., 2014)). However, this approach is restrictive because fixed thresholds that accurately delineate taxa in one part of the fungal tree of life may not be accurate for other clades in the tree (Vu et al., 2016, 2019; Vu et al., 2022). Dnabarcoder is a tool that has been developed to address this issue by predicting similarity cutoffs for different fungal clades in a reference sequence dataset and can also classify sequences (via BLAST) using these predicted cutoff (Vu et al., 2022).\nMinimap2 (Li, 2018) and Kraken2 (Wood et al., 2019) can be used as alternatives to BLAST for taxonomic classification. They both use minimisers (Roberts et al., 2004) to improve performance and handle long, potentially noisy reads.\nAlternatively, there is an expanding field of machine learning (ML) techniques to classify sequences. Generally, ML techniques optimise a computer model to correctly identify sequences from a training set (where the taxonomic identity of sequences are known). The trained model is then used to classify new, unseen sequences. ML techniques will not be discussed in detail here but some notable tools for taxonomic classification are: the Naive Bayesian Classifier (Wang et al., 2007), SINTAX (Edgar, 2016) and IDTAXA (Murali et al., 2018). Recent neural network based classification methods such as MycoAI (Romeijn et al., 2024) show promise in rapid performance with comparable accuracy to other classification methods.\nPhylogenetic placement algorithms such as pplacer (Matsen et al., 2010) and EPA-ng (Barbera et al., 2019) place amplicon reads onto a pre-established phylogenetic tree. They are not well suited for ITS sequences due to the high variability in length and content that produces alignments with low accuracy, but work well with more conserved regions such as 16S, SSU and LSU (Furneaux et al., 2021; Tedersoo et al., 2022).\n\nHigh throughput sequencing techniques applied to metabarcoding have detected a high diversity of fungal taxa that are undescribed and entire groups (even phyla) that cannot be placed within the current fungal tree of life (Nilsson, Larsson, et al., 2019; Phukhamsakda et al., 2022). These so-called \"dark taxa\" do not seem to form discernible morphological structures or be cultivatable in the lab, therefore dark taxa are predominantly detected by DNA sequencing (Nilsson et al., 2023). In some cases of environmental metabarcoding, dark taxa make up the majority of taxa recovered (Retter et al., 2019). Long-read sequencing technology is being used to help phylogenetic placement for previously undescribed sequences by capturing the SSU and LSU genes in combination with the ITS region and improving taxonomic resolution (Tedersoo et al., 2020). Taxa known only from sequence data poses a dilemma for the field of mycology as the existing taxonomic system requires morphology-based classification (James et al., 2020). This trend is expected to continue as the cost of sequencing decreases and the volume of undescribed sequences continues to grow and outnumber the fully described taxa (James et al., 2020).\n\n\n\n\nAbarenkov,K. et al.

We aim to explore this space and test methods that might prove useful for future metabarcoding pipelines. Due to its relatively low cost and portability, ONT has made sequencing much more accessible by enabling groups to purchase and run their own sequencing devices that would otherwise not be able to afford it. This democratisation of technology has provided much wider access to sequencing techniques, gaining the interest of those who may not have a background in biology or informatics.

    "text": "1.1 Adapter and primer trimming\nSequencing adapters were trimmed from raw basecalled reads using dorado v0.6.1 with the ‘--no-trim-primers’ option to avoid removing primer sequences. Cutadapt v4.6 (Martin, 2011) was used to select and trim primers from amplicons that contain both forward (NS5) and reverse primer (LR6) sequences. Amplicons where both of these primer sequences could not be detected were excluded from the analysis. Cutadapt was also used to re-orient reads from the reverse strand (‘--revcomp’ option), facilitating analysis by downstream tools (Figure 1).\n\n\n1.2 ITS extraction and quality filtering\nThe full ITS region of these reads was extracted using ITSxpress v2.0.1 (Rivers et al., 2018) with default settings other than ‘--single_end’ and ‘--taxa Fungi’ options. Chopper v0.7.0 (De Coster and Rademakers, 2023) was used to select reads of the full ITS region having a length between 300-6000bp and mean Phred quality score above Q20. Chimeric reads were detected with VSEARCH v2.21.1 (Rognes et al., 2016) using de novo and reference based methods.

The steps applied to raw reads are shown in boxes with the software used in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Clustering\nFor each scenario, full ITS sequences were grouped into approximate species-level OTUs using two clustering approaches (Figure 2).\nThe first approach uses de novo centroid-based clustering on sequence similarity as implemented in VSEARCH v2.21.1 (Rognes et al., 2016). The sequences were first de-replicated using VSEARCH’s ‘--fastx_uniques’ option to merge identical sequences into a single record, then clustered with the ‘--cluster_size’ option. 97% identity was used as the pairwise sequence similarity threshold. This clustering approach resulted in many low-abundance operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Methods for selecting a threshold to remove low-abundance spurious OTUs are explored in Section 6.1.2.\nThe second clustering approach grouped sequences by similarity of their k-mer signatures. We implemented our own version of the clustering approach used by the NanoCLUST pipeline (Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2021). Each sequence was transformed into a k-mer frequency vector and stored in a tabular format. In our workflow, 6-mer frequencies were computed (as opposed to 5-mers in NanoCLUST) based on existing work done by Langsiri et al. (2023). The multidimensional tabular structure was then projected into two-dimensions using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (McInnes et al., 2020). Sequences (represented as points in the two-dimensional space) were then clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) (McInnes et al., 2017). The ‘cluster_selection_epsilon’ parameter used in HDBSCAN was set to 0.5, while the multiple ‘min_cluster_size’ parameters were tested and explored in Section 6.1.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nderep\n\nRead dereplication\n(vsearch)\n\n\n\nvsearch\n\n97% identity clustering\n(vsearch)\n\n\n\nderep-&gt;vsearch\n\n\n\n\n\nconsA\n\nConsensus sequence\n(polishing)\n\n\n\nvsearch-&gt;consA\n\n\n\n\n\ncentr\n\ncentroids\n(vsearch)\n\n\n\nvsearch-&gt;centr\n\n\n\n\n\nkmer\n\nk-mer frequencies\n(python)\n\n\n\numap\n\nDimension reduction\n(UMAP)\n\n\n\nkmer-&gt;umap\n\n\n\n\n\nhdbscan\n\nClustering\n(HDBSCAN)\n\n\n\numap-&gt;hdbscan\n\n\n\n\n\nmostA\n\nMost abundant sequence\n(vsearch)\n\n\n\nhdbscan-&gt;mostA\n\n\n\n\n\nhdbscan-&gt;consA\n\n\n\n\n\nreps\nRepresentative sequences\nfor classification\n\n\n\nmostA-&gt;reps\n\n\n\n\n\nconsA-&gt;reps\n\n\n\n\n\ncentr-&gt;reps\n\n\n\n\n\nqc\nQuality filtered\nfull ITS sequences\n\n\n\nqc-&gt;derep\n\n\n\n\n\nqc-&gt;kmer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Stages of clustering in our workflow. Reads were clustered using two approaches: VSEARCH and NanoCLUST (UMAP + HDBSCAN). Software tools used are shown in parentheses. A representative sequence from each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was selected based either on the most abundant sequence or the consensus sequence.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Taxonomic assignments\nA representative sequence was selected from each OTU to aid their taxonomic assignment. Our initial approach used the most abundant sequence as the representative sequence of each OTU. VSEARCH supplied the most abundant sequences with the ‘--centroids’ option. To determine the most abundant sequence from OTUs in the UMAP + HDBSCAN approach, the VSEARCH v2.21.1 ‘--fastx_uniques’ command in combination with ‘--topn 1’ option was used (Figure 2).\nAlternatively, a consensus sequence was built from the reads of each OTU following a similar approach used by the NanoCLUST pipeline (Figure 3). First, a subset of 200 sequences was selected from each OTU to reduce computation time and space requirements. Then, the read with the highest Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) to all the other sequences was chosen as the ‘draft’ sequence for the OTU. This was performed with FastANI v1.34 (Jain et al., 2018). The subset of 200 reads were then aligned to the draft sequence using minimap2 v2.28 (Li, 2018). Subsequently, the draft read underwent polishing using racon v1.5.0 (Vaser et al., 2017) then medaka v1.12.0 (https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka). We were unable to use Canu (Koren et al., 2017) in the same manner as the original NanoCLUST pipeline implementation. Canu is designed as a long-read assembler, it has a strict minimum genome size of 1000 making it unable to polish full ITS sequences from this dataset (which were around 400bp).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubset\n\nSubset reads for polishing\n(n=200)\n\n\n\nfastANI\n\nSelect draft by max ANI\n(fastANI)\n\n\n\nsubset-&gt;fastANI\n\n\n\n\n\nminimap\n\nAlign reads to draft\n(minimap2)\n\n\n\nsubset-&gt;minimap:sw\n\n\n\n\n\nracon\n\nPolish draft\n(racon)\n\n\n\nsubset-&gt;racon:sw\n\n\n\n\n\nmedaka\n\nPolish draft\n(medaka)\n\n\n\nsubset-&gt;medaka:nw\n\n\n\n\n\nfastANI-&gt;minimap\n\n\n\n\n\nfastANI:ne-&gt;racon:nw\n\n\n\n\n\nminimap-&gt;racon\n\n\n\n\n\nracon-&gt;medaka\n\n\n\n\n\nreps\nRepresentative sequences\nfor classification\n\n\n\nmedaka-&gt;reps\n\n\n\n\n\nreads\nSet of reads in same cluster\n\n\n\nreads-&gt;subset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Stages of consensus sequence generation in our workflow. The process of producing a consensus sequence for each OTU by selecting and polishing a draft read. An initial draft sequence was selected by taking the read with the highest Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) from the first 200 reads in the OTU. The subset of 200 reads were first aligned to the draft sequence, then polished using racon (Vaser et al., 2017) and medaka (https://github.com/nanoporetech/medaka).\n\n\n\nThe representative sequence from each OTU was then given a taxonomic assignment with dnabarcoder v1.0.6 (Vu et al., 2022). In this case, full ITS sequences were classified against the UNITE+INSD 2024 reference database (Abarenkov et al., 2024; Vu, 2024) using precomputed similarity cutoffs provided by the dnabarcoder project (Vu et al., 2022).\n\n\n1.5 Workflow implementation\nThe workflow was implemented using the Nextflow language (Di Tommaso et al., 2017) and was developed to run with Singularity (Kurtzer et al., 2017) or Docker (Merkel et al., 2014) containers. A container-based approach is flexible and allows the workflow to run on all systems that support either one of these container platforms. It also simplifies the setup of dependencies and enhances reproducibility between installations. The workflow only requires Nextflow and a container platform (Singularity or Docker) to be installed.\nThe source code for the workflow is available online at https://github.com/aringeri/nanoporcini.\nIt can be configured to customise the use of system resources such as number of threads or RAM. The following parameters of the workflow are also configurable:\n\nForward and reverse primer sequences.\nMinimum quality score for full ITS sequences.\nMinimum and maximum length for full ITS sequences.\nMinimum cluster size for HDBSCAN clustering algorithm.\nPercent identity similarity threshold for VSEARCH clustering.\nReference database used for chimera detection and taxonomic classifications.",

    "text": "2 Mock fungal communities\nIn order to understand the behaviour of our workflow under different sampling scenarios, a mock dataset was constructed using sequences from 65 fungal taxa which had been isolated and identified from mycelia or spores. We constructed mock communities by mixing reads from these taxa and aimed to emulate data that might be encountered when sampling a complex fungal community. We constructed two varieties of mock scenarios by controlling the relative proportion of reads from each fungal taxon:\n\nEven abundance where all fungal taxa had the same relative abundance of read count.\nUneven abundance where a subset of fungal taxa had a much lower abundance relative to the other taxa.\n\nThe raw basecalled reads were provided to us by collaborators from the Schwessinger Group at Australian National University (ANU). Our collaborators have performed: the identification and isolation of all fungal taxa, DNA library preparation, DNA sequencing and basecalling. Table A2 provides the list of fungal taxa and the number of raw reads that were available to us for generating these mock scenarios. The steps to generate and prepare reads for these mock datasets are outlined below.\n\n2.1 Preparation of reads from fungal taxa for mock scenarios\n\nDNA extraction, amplification and sequencing\nThe genomic DNA of 65 fungal taxa was extracted with the Qiagen DNeasy Plant mini kit. The DNA was extracted from mycelia or spore material of each fungal taxa. Partial SSU, full ITS region and partial LSU regions of each sample were amplified with primers NS5 (forward) and LR6 (reverse) (Figure 1). The amplicons were prepared with ONT’s Native Barcoding Kit 96 V14 (SQK-NBD114.96). The fungal samples plus a negative control were sequenced together with a MinION R10.4 flow cell.\n\n\nBioinformatics - Basecalling\nThe raw ONT data was basecalled and demultiplexed using guppy v6.4.2 with the super-high accuracy model (dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup).\n\n\nBioinformatics - Selection of high quality full ITS sequences\nThe basecalled reads were passed to the adapter trimming, primer trimming, ITS extraction, quality filtering and chimera detection stages of our workflow described in Section 5.1. At this point, we had a pool of high quality full ITS sequences which we used to construct different mock communities.\nAfter being processed by the workflow, 7 of the 65 fungal taxa were excluded from the mock dataset leaving 58 taxa available for mock scenarios. 6 of the 7 excluded taxa were removed due to having a low number of reads. Due to differences in chimera detection behaviour between reference databases, 1 of the 7 excluded taxa was removed erroneously under the impression that it had a low number of reads (Fusarium proliferatum).\nA minimum of 2,500 reads per taxa was required to construct even-abundance mock scenarios with library sizes nearing 150K reads (\\(58 \\text{ taxa} \\times 2500 \\text{ reads} = 145000\\text{ reads}\\)). The samples that were excluded (with updated names in parentheses) were: Aspergillus niger, Naganishia albida (Cryptococcus albidus), Geotrichum candidum (Galactomyces geotrichum), Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Yarrowia lipolytica, Fusarium proliferatum and Puccinia recondita (Puccinia triticina). The footnotes in Table A2 indicate which taxa were excluded from mock scenarios.\nOf the 58 remaining taxa, six had the same species-level designation making for a total 55 unique species in the mock dataset. \n\n\nTaxonomic naming validation\nTo ensure that taxonomic names were used consistently between the fungal samples and the reference database, manual validation of each sample name was performed by conducting searches for the recorded species name of each sample in the 2024 UNITE+INSD reference database (Abarenkov et al., 2024; Vu, 2024). Most mismatches were either due to names being misspelled or due to use of taxonomic synonyms. For example, Nakaseomyces glabratus in UNITE was originally recorded by its former name Candida glabrata. Names of samples were manually updated using current names found in both Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org) and the 2024 UNITE reference database. For samples that were not classified at the species level (e.g. Entoleuca sp CCL052), the genus label (e.g. Entoleuca) was confirmed to exist in the reference database.\n\n\n\n2.2 Scenario 1 - Even abundance\nThe first mock scenario emulated an even community structure where every fungal taxa had an equal abundance in terms of number of reads. Libraries of differing sizes were generated by subsampling an equal number of reads from each taxa. For each of the 58 taxa: 20; 50; 167; 1,000; 2,000 and 2,500 reads were randomly selected to produce libraries with sizes of 1,160; 2,900; 9,686; 58,000; 116,000 and 145,000 reads (Figure 4). Seqtk v1.4 (Lh3/seqtk: Toolkit for processing sequences in FASTA/Q formats) was used to perform the subsampling (with the ‘sample’ command). The subsampling was repeated five times for each library size producing a total of 30 libraries (6 libraries \\(\\times\\) 5 repetitions). The random seed values given to seqtk’s ‘sample’ command for each repetition were generated deterministically so that each run of the workflow was reproducible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Process for generating mock communities with equal abundances. Equal numbers of reads were selected from each fungal taxa then combined into a single library. The process was repeated with different subsampling depth to produce libraries with different sizes. Five replicate libraries of each size were created where clustering and taxonomic assignment was performed on each library individually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Process for generating mock communities with uneven abundances. Five fungal taxa were subsampled at a low rate (between 5 and 100 reads). The remaining 50 fungal taxa were subsampled at a fixed higher rate. The ‘high-abundance’ fungal taxa were subsampled at rates between 200 and 2,000 reads to produce four libraries. Clustering and taxonomic assignment was performed on each library individually.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Scenario 2 - Uneven (5 low abundance)\nAs it is unlikely in a ‘real world’ environmental sample for all taxa to have the same number of reads, we aimed to model situations where a subset of taxa had a disproportionately low number of reads. For this scenario, we selected five taxa to be subsampled at a low abundance, while a remaining 50 taxa were subsampled at a higher abundance (Figure 5). The low-abundance taxa Trichomonascus ciferrii, Erysiphe necator, Eutypa lata, Penicillium chrysogenum and Candida zeylanoides, were subsampled at levels of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 reads respectively. The remaining 50 high-abundance taxa were subsampled at an even rate and mixed with the low-abundance reads. This process was repeated to produce different library sizes by subsampling the ‘high-abundance’ taxa at rates of 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 reads per taxon, while keeping the ‘low-abundance’ taxa unchanged. This produced library sizes of 10185, 25185, 50185, 100185 reads respectively.\nTrichomonascus ciferrii, Erysiphe necator, Eutypa lata, Penicillium chrysogenum and Candida zeylanoides were randomly selected as the low-abundance taxa. To simplify the interpretation of this scenario, we ensured that we did not subsample from the same species more than once (i.e. from two fungal taxa with the same species-level designation). To do this, the following fungal taxa were excluded from the set of quality filtered reads: Austropuccinia psidii 2, Cryptococcus gattii VG III, Cryptococcus neoformans VNI in addition to those from Scenario 1. The footnotes in Table A2 show which taxa were excluded from mock scenarios.",

    "text": "3 Real world - Soil case study\nA set of soil samples were made available to us to test the workflow on a real world environmental data. 24 samples were collected from soil beneath four trees species in heathy woodland from the Cranbourne Conservation area in Victoria, Australia (Table A6). Six soil samples were taken from soil beneath each of the tree species: Allocasuarina littoralis, Allocasuarina paradoxa, Eucalyptus viminalis and Eucalyptus cephalocarpa. Two control samples were sequenced: one control (ExCon) contained only the contents of the DNA extraction kit and the other was a negative PCR control (PCRNegCon).\n\n3.1 DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing\nGenomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from all soil samples. One Eucalyptus cephalocarpa sample (EC4) was excluded due to low gDNA concentration. Library preparation and sequencing of extracted gDNA followed the protocol found at https://www.protocols.io/view/sequencing-fungal-metabarcode-with-pcr-primer-base-81wgbxm41lpk/v1. This protocol used a custom barcoding scheme which amplified full ITS and partial LSU regions with primers which included DNA barcodes (Hebert et al., 2023; Ohta et al., 2023). The modified forward primer was ITS1_F_KYO2 and reverse primer was LR6. Amplicons were sequenced using the ONT MinION 10.4.1.\n\n\n3.2 Bioinformatics - basecalling and demultiplexing\nThe raw ONT data was basecalled using dorado v0.7.1 with the super-high accuracy model (dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_sup@v5.0.0). Due to the custom barcoding scheme, basecalled reads were demultiplexed with minibar v0.25 (Table A7).\n\n\n3.3 Sample selection\nOne Allocasuarina paradoxa (AP6) sample was excluded due to having much lower read count than other samples (Table A7). This left 24 samples (22 soil samples + 2 controls) for downstream processing.\n\n\n3.4 Metabarcoding workflow\nThe set of demultiplexed reads was passed to our metabarcoding workflow (v0.0.1) with default settings. Adapter trimming, primer trimming, ITS extraction, quality filtering and chimera detection was performed as described in Section 5.1. Due to a large library size after quality control (~1.8 million reads), computational constraints did not allow our NanoCLUST implementation to cluster the full dataset. Instead, VSEARCH was used for clustering with 97% identity. Singleton OTUs were removed after clustering and the remaining OTUs were classified by their most abundant sequence using dnabarcoder and the UNITE+INSD 2024 reference database.\n\n\n3.5 Data analysis\nAn OTU table and dnabarcoder’s classifications table was imported into the phyloseq v1.48.0 R package (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). The decontam v1.24.0 R package (Davis et al., 2018) was used to remove contaminant sequences identified in the two control samples. Low-abundance OTUs were filtered in a sample-wise fashion: OTUs were removed from a sample if they were smaller than 0.15% of the total number of reads in the sample. This cutoff was chosen based on the results of experimentation with the mock community trials. The scripts used to perform this analysis have been published on GitHub for reference: https://github.com/aringeri/long-read-ITS-metabarcoding-thesis/tree/main/reports/masters/thesis/analysis.\n\n\n\n\nAbarenkov,K. et al.

    "text": "1.1 Quality control\nAfter quality control, there was considerable read loss across the fungal taxa used to construct the mock scenarios (Table A2). A minimum of 2,500 reads per taxa was required to construct even-abundance mock scenarios with library sizes nearing 150K reads (\\(58 \\text{ taxa} \\times 2500 \\text{ reads} = 145000\\text{ reads}\\)). This can be seen in Figure 1, where seven samples are excluded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Read loss for taxa used in mock scenarios after quality control. The distribution of read counts per sample before (A) and after (B) quality control processing. Reads having less than 2,500 reads were excluded from mock scenarios (dotted line in B). Note the x-axis is on a log scale.\n\n\n\nTracking read counts at each stage of the workflow has shown that the majority of reads were lost in the primer trimming and quality filtering stages of the workflow (Figure 2). An average of 32.37% of reads were lost across samples after applying cutadapt to select and trim amplicons that contain both forward (ITS1F) and reverse primer (LR3) sequences. The extraction of the full ITS region led to an average loss of 10.65% trimmed reads across samples. An average of 71.82% of full ITS sequences were lost after selecting reads between 300-6,000bp in length and having a mean quality score above Q20 (Phred scale). Such large loss of reads can be attributed to many of the reads from the dataset being below the minimum mean quality threshold of Q20 (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Read loss for taxa used in mock scenarios at filtering and trimming stages of the workflow. Each point represents a fungal isolate sample. Taxa that were excluded from downstream mock scenarios due to low read count have been coloured red. The blue horizontal bar with percentages indicate the mean proportion of reads lost from the previous step. The mean proportion of read loss was only calculated for samples that were not excluded from downstream scenarios. Each step was executed in order from left to right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Mean read quality of reads from 58 fungal taxa before trimming or filtering steps. The raw reads have been produced by a MinION R10.4 flow cell after basecalling with guppy v6.4.2 (super-high accuracy model). Quality scores are in the Phred (Q) scale. Read lengths are shown in thousands of basepairs. Histograms on X and Y axes indicate the density of reads at respective quality scores and read lengths. (Plot generated by NanoPlot (De Coster and Rademakers, 2023))\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Even abundance scenario\n\nMinimum cluster size threshold to recover the expected number of species\nThe adopted clustering approaches aimed to group full ITS sequences from the same species together in the same OTU. The total number of OTUs was used as a measure for successfully estimating the number of species in the mock community. In this section we considered the even abundance mock community where 58 fungal taxa were equally represented (Section 5.2). Of the 58 taxa, some had the same species-level designation making for a total of 55 unique species.\nTwo clustering approaches were tested: a greedy sequence similarity-based clustering approach with VSEARCH and a k-mer signature based clustering approach (as implemented in NanoCLUST). To recover the expected number of species from the mock community, both clustering approaches required a technique to filter out low-abundance OTUs.\nThe number of OTUs returned by VSEARCH at 97% sequence identity was consistently larger than the actual number of species present in the mock community. VSEARCH significantly over-estimated the number of species in the mock community when no filtering was applied to the resulting set of OTUs. Furthermore, this over-estimation was exacerbated as the library size increased. As a significant proportion of these OTUs had low abundance, to recover the expected number of species in the mock community, we implemented a crude cutoff which removed OTUs below a minimum size. We set the cutoff to a proportion of the total library size and tested values between 0% and 2% (Figure 4). We repeated the test for 6 different library sizes (1,160; 2,900; 9,686; 58,000; 116,000; and 145,000 reads) where all fungal taxa had equal abundances.\nWith VSEARCH, we observed consistent behaviour when applying the minimum OTU size cutoff at all library sizes. The number of OTUs was very high without a minimum OTU size cutoff, then decreased and stabilised near the expected number of species as the OTU size cutoff increased. We observed that setting the minimum OTU size to be 0.15% of the library size consistently recovered the expected number of species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Impact of a minimum OTU size cutoff on clustering methods in mock scenario. The number of OTUs and the proportion of read loss is shown for NanoCLUST (in red) and VSEARCH (in blue) clustering methods. These are results from the even abundance scenario. Plots have been organised in columns by increasing library size. The top row of plots shows the number of OTUs after applying a minimum cluster size cutoff that is a proportion of the library size. The bottom row of plots show the proportion of reads that are lost after applying the minimum OTU size cutoff. The mean values of each have been plotted after five random resamplings at each library size. The dashed line indicates the actual number of species in the mock scenario.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we tested the k-mer based clustering approach used by the NanoCLUST pipeline. Within the NanoCLUST pipeline, HDBSCAN is the algorithm that performs the clustering and requires specifying a minimum cluster size parameter a priori. Similar to our approach with VSEARCH, we tested multiple values of HDBSCAN’s minimum cluster size parameter on the even abundance mock community for 6 different library sizes (1,160; 2,900; 9,686; 58,000; 116,000; and 145,000 reads). We tested a range of minimum cluster sizes between 0% and 2% of the total library size. We found that when the minimum cluster size parameter was set to its minimum value (2 reads), the NanoCLUST method overestimated the number of species for library sizes of 1,160 reads and above. With the minimum cluster size parameter set to 2, the number of OTUs showed a positive correlation with library size but not as dramatically as with VSEARCH. For library sizes of 1,160 reads and above, a minimum cluster size of 0.65% of the total library size consistently recovered the expected number of species.\n\nTo aid the comparison of VSEARCH and NanoCLUST clustering methods, we recorded the proportion of reads that were lost due to defining a minimum OTU size. We defined the proportion of reads lost for VSEARCH as:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{\\# of reads removed when filtering OTUs by size}}{\\text{\\# number of reads in library}}\n\\]\nand for Nanoclust as:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{\\# of unclustered reads}}{\\text{\\# number of reads in library}}\n\\]\nWe found that for low library sizes (1,160-9,686 reads), the NanoCLUST method produced closer estimates of the actual number of species with lower read loss than VSEARCH for all minimum OTU sizes. For larger library sizes (58K-145K reads) using the VSEARCH method, we observed a consistent pattern of read loss for all library sizes. The NanoCLUST method became less consistent for larger library sizes and lost a higher proportion reads to recover the same number of species as VSEARCH (Figure 4). \n\n\n\nComputing number of species after taxonomic assignments\nWhile we were able to demonstrate above that the expected number of species can be recovered by setting a minimum OTU size, the number of OTUs may not be an accurate measure of the actual number of species. For example, one species may have been split into multiple OTUs which have all been given the same species-level taxonomic assignment. In addition, we wanted to explore using a minimum OTU size threshold that was not proportional to the library size. We felt that a minimum OTU size of 0.65% for NanoCLUST and 0.15% for VSEARCH would exclude low-abundance species and may bias against samples with low read depth.\nHere we explored the observed number of species in our even abundance mock community after assigning OTUs. We performed VSEARCH and NanoCLUST clustering methods on four library sizes of 9,686; 58,000; 116,000 and 145,000 reads. HDBSCAN clustering was performed six times for each library with minimum cluster sizes of: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 reads. VSEARCH clustering was performed once for each library at 97% identity, then OTUs with fewer than: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 reads were removed. The most abundant sequence was used at the representative sequence for each OTU and given a taxonomic assignment with dnabarcoder using the UNITE+INSD 2024 database.\nFor each minimum OTU size, we counted the number of unique taxonomic assignments given at the species level.  Of the OTUs that were given a species-level assignment, we counted the number of species that were known to be in the mock community (listed in Table A2). For OTUs that were only identified to genus or family level, we counted the number of OTUs that had genus or family level labels that were known to be in the mock community. OTUs that were identified at species, genus or family levels but whose taxonomic labels were not expected in the mock community were counted as false positives. OTUs that were unidentified at the family level or higher were recorded as ‘unidentified’ (Figure 5). We also recorded the proportion of read loss as in the previous section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Number of species after ‘collapsing’ OTUs with the same species-level taxonomic assignment in mock scenario. The even abundance mock community was clustered with VSEARCH and NanoCLUST, and six minimum OTU sizes were tested (2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100). Each OTU was given a taxonomic assignment with dnabarcoder using the UNITE+INSD 2024 database. The dark blue line (first two rows) shows the number of OTUs after clustering. Green bars show the number of species that were known to be in the mock community. Yellow bars show the number of OTUs that were assigned at the genus level, and whose genus label was known to be in the mock community. Orange bars show the number of OTUs that were assigned at the family level, and whose family label was known to be in the mock community. Red bars show the number of OTUs that were assigned at the species, genus or family level but whose taxonomic label was not found in the mock community. Grey bars show the number of OTUs that were unidentified at the family level or above. The process was repeated for four library sizes of 9,686; 58,000; 116,000 and 145,000 reads. The bottom row of plots show the proportion of reads that are lost after applying the minimum OTU size cutoff.\n\n\n\nWe observed that ‘collapsing’ OTUs by their species-level identification was more accurate in estimating the number of species in the mock community compared to using the number OTUs. We found that a core set of species from the mock community remained regardless of minimum OTU size or library size (green bars in Figure 5). When the library size increased, we observed an increase in OTUs that were unidentified or assigned to the expected genus and family levels for both NanoCLUST and VSEARCH. Increasing the minimum OTU size with VSEARCH mostly removed OTUs that were unidentified or assigned to genera from the mock community. NanoCLUST overestimated the number of species regardless of the minimum OTU size, but had the benefit of much lower read loss than VSEARCH.\n\n\nComparing cluster delineation between VSEARCH and NanoCLUST\nTo investigate if closely related species could be distinguished after clustering, we looked at a single execution of the even abundance mock scenario where 2,000 reads were selected from each of the 58 fungal taxa giving a total library size of 116K reads. Reads were clustered separately with the NanoCLUST and VSEARCH methods. Reads that were clustered with the NanoCLUST method used a minimum cluster size of 580 reads (0.5% of the library size). VSEARCH clustering used a 97% identity and OTUs that had fewer than 174 reads (0.15% of library size) were removed. The most abundant sequences of each OTU were classified with dnabarcoder and the UNITE+INSD 2024 reference database.\nThe samples from the order Pucciniales are shown in Figure 6. Using the NanoCLUST method, the majority of reads from the Puccinia striiformis (var tritici) sample (BC 25) clustered together into a single OTU (OTU 37) with the expected species-level classification (Puccinia striiformis). The remaining reads from the P. striiformis (var tritici) sample clustered into singleton OTUs which did not correspond to the expected taxonomic label. The Botrytis classification of one of these OTUs corresponds to another fungal taxa present in the library and may be indicative of index-switching (where a sequencing error has occurred in the barcode region of the read).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Clustering of Pucciniales using the NanoCLUST (UMAP + HDBSCAN) and VSEARCH methods. Each plot shows the reads from a single fungal taxon and bars indicate the number of reads from the taxon placed in an OTU. The taxonomic classification given by dnabarcoder (with the UNITE 2024 database) for each OTU is shown in the x-axis labels. Green bars indicate that the assignment given to an OTU matches the expected species-level classification. Red bars indicate that the classification is incorrect for family-level and above. Grey bars indicate that the cluster could not be given any taxonomic classification at all. Bars marked with an asterix (*) indicate that taxonomic labels differed between reference database and our sample but were still considered the same species.\n\n\n\nFor Puccinia graminis (BC 27) when using the NanoCLUST method, the majority of the reads were split into two OTUs, both of which were classified as the expected P. graminis species. Using the VSEARCH method, the majority of the Puccinia graminis reads clustered into a single correctly identified OTU. This likely indicates that biological variation exists in the P. graminis sample that the NanoCLUST method was capable of detecting while VSEARCH (at 97% identity) could not. The majority of reads for both Austropuccinia psidii samples (BC 28 and 36) were split into the same two OTUs (OTU 38 and 21) which have been classified as Puccinia psidii. A similar plot for all samples in this mock community can be seen in Figure A1 with classifications shown in Table A4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Clustering of selected Candida using the NanoCLUST (UMAP + HDBSCAN) and VSEARCH methods. Each plot shows the reads from a single fungal taxon and bars indicate the number of reads from the taxon placed in an OTU. The taxonomic classification given by dnabarcoder (with the UNITE 2024 database) for each OTU is shown in the x-axis labels. Green bars indicate that the assignment given to an OTU matches the expected species-level classification. Yellow bars indicate a correct genus-level classification. Red bars indicate that the classification is incorrect for family-level and above. Grey bars indicate that the OTU could not be given any taxonomic classification at all.\n\n\n\nWe observed similar clustering behaviour between VSEARCH and NanoCLUST for taxa in the genus Candida (Figure 7). With VSEARCH, sequences from C. albicans (BC47) were placed into three OTUs. The OTU that received the most reads from C. albicans was classified correctly, while the other two were classified to other taxa in the mock community (C. orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis). A similar pattern was observed using NanoCLUST, although the major OTU was not classified correctly at the species-level and there were many more low-abundance OTUs (below 40 reads). The majority of sequences from C. caryicola (BC49) were placed into two unclassified OTUs for both clustering methods. Sequences from C. metapsilosis (BC53) and C. orthopsilosis (BC54) showed significant similarity as VSEARCH placed the majority of reads from both taxa in the same OTU, while NanoCLUST placed a similar proportion of reads from each taxon into two major OTUs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Clustering of genus Cryptococcus using the NanoCLUST (UMAP + HDBSCAN) and VSEARCH methods. Each plot shows the reads from a single fungal taxon and bars indicate the number of reads from the taxon placed in an OTU. The taxonomic classification given by dnabarcoder (with the UNITE 2024 database) for each OTU is shown in the x-axis labels. Green bars indicate that the assignment given to an OTU matches the expected species-level classification. Yellow bars indicate a correct genus-level classification. Red bars indicate that the classification is incorrect for family-level and above. Grey bars indicate that the OTU could not be given any taxonomic classification at all.\n\n\n\nIn the genus Cryptococcus, with NanoCLUST, reads from C. gattii VG I (BC59) were placed into one major OTU with the correct species-level assignment while VSEARCH split reads into three major OTUs (Figure 8). With VSEARCH, we observed a significant proportion of reads from all four Cryptococcus taxa were placed into the same OTU (OTU 9), while with NanoCLUST this only occurred for three of the taxa (C. gattii VG III (BC60), C. neoformans VNI (BC61) and C. neoformans VN IV (BC62)). A proportion of reads from Cryptococcus gatii VG III (BC60) were misclassified as Candida ortholopsis, while a proportion of reads from Cryptococcus neoformans VNI (BC61) were misclassified as Kluveromyces marxianus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Clustering of family Sclerotiniaceae using the NanoCLUST (UMAP + HDBSCAN) and VSEARCH methods. Each plot shows the reads from a single fungal taxon and bars indicate the number of reads from the taxon placed in an OTU. The taxonomic classification given by dnabarcoder (with the UNITE 2024 database) for each OTU is shown in the x-axis labels. Green bars indicate that the assignment given to an OTU matches the expected species-level classification. Yellow bars indicate a correct genus-level classification. Red bars indicate that the classification is incorrect for family-level and above. Grey bars indicate that the OTU could not be given any taxonomic classification at all.\n\n\n\nFor the Sclerotiniaceae family, we found that both Botrytis taxa (BC31 and BC32) were placed in the same OTU with both NanoCLUST and VSEARCH. With VSEARCH, 516 reads from Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were also placed in the same OTU with the Botrytis taxa. With NanoCLUST, the majority of reads were placed into one correctly identified OTU.\nOverall, with these clustering setting, NanoCLUST and VSEARCH performed similarly for delineating the majority of the taxa. In the Cryptococcus and Sclerotiniaceae cases, NanoCLUST was observed to perform better at delineating closely related taxa. However, in Candida and Cryptococcus cases, we observed many more low-abundance OTUs with incorrect taxonomic assignments for NanoCLUST compared to VSEARCH.\n\n\nComparison of representative sequence used for taxonomic assignment\nTo explore the accuracy of taxonomic classifications made by the workflow, two metrics were computed for the even abundance mock scenario (Scenario 1). The genera classification proportion metric for all fungal taxa was defined as:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{\\# of reads classified at the genera level}}{\\text{total \\# of reads in library}}\n\\]\nThe genera precision metric for all fungal taxa was defined as:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{\\# of reads classified correctly at the genera level}}{\\text{\\# of reads classified at the genera level}}\n\\]\nThese metrics were calculated for five library sizes (between 2,900 and 145,000 reads) for both NanoCLUST and VSEARCH clustering methods (Figure 10). We explored which representative sequence from an OTU gave more accurate taxonomic classifications: most abundant sequence or consensus sequence. Consensus sequences were generated by polishing a subset of sequences from each OTU as described in Section 5.1.\nA read’s classification was deemed ‘correct’ if its genus-level label matched the sample from which the read originated. This approach had limitations and was difficult to ensure taxonomic assignments were correct in an automated fashion due to synonymous naming conventions. Manual adjustments were made for the following assignments that would have been otherwise considered misclassified:\n\nReads classified as Puccinia psidii from the Austropuccinia psidii sample were considered to be a correct species-level assignment.\nReads classified to the Kurtzmaniella genus from the Candida boleticola or Candida zeylanoides samples were considered to be correct genus-level assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Classification proportion and precision between most abundant sequences and consensus sequences. The proportion of classified reads and the precision of classifications at the genera level between the most abundant sequence and consensus sequence are shown. Classification metrics were calculated for the even-abundance mock scenario with five library sizes of 2,900; 9,686; 58,000; 116,000 and 145,000 reads. Five replicates were performed for each library. Red points show classification proportion and precision when using the most abundance sequence from OTUs. Blue points show classification proportion and precision when using a consensus sequence from OTUs. Consensus sequence metrics were not shown for VSEARCH due very low classification proportion (35% and below).\n\n\n\nFor NanoCLUST, we observed that clustering with a min_cluster_size of 2 and classifying the most abundant sequence gave the most consistent results across all library sizes. In this case, for all library sizes, ~95% of reads were classified and 82.5% to 85% of these classifications were correct. We observed that increasing the min_cluster_size parameter introduced variability in these metrics and generally worsened classification performance. When clustering with a min_cluster_size parameter of 2 and using the consensus sequence for classifications, the classification precision improved slightly while the proportion of reads that were classified decreased.\nFor VSEARCH when using the most abundant sequence, we observed that increasing the minimum OTU size decreased the proportion of reads classified at the genera level by ~2.5% while the classification precision did not change significantly. The classification rate of consensus sequences for VSEARCH was very poor with more than 65% of reads being unclassified at the genera level. Overall, both NanoCLUST and VSEARCH approaches performed comparably when the minimum OTU size was low and the most abundant sequence was used for classifications.\n\n\n\n1.3 Uneven abundance Scenario\n\n\nSensitivity of cluster thresholds in uneven abundance scenarios\nTo explore the impact that a minimum OTU size cutoff might have on rare species in a real environmental sample, we created a mock scenario where a subset of fungal taxa had much lower abundance than others. This mock community contained a total of 55 fungal taxa where 50 taxa each had an abundance of 2,000 reads, while the remaining five taxa had abundances of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 reads, making for a total library size of 100,185 reads. We examined the minimum OTU size cutoff at which low-abundance taxa would be lost (Figure 11).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Impact of the minimum OTU size on low abundance taxa in mock scenario. Each plot shows the OTUs that contained reads from the five ‘low-abundance’ fungal taxa. The OTUs and their taxonomic classification (given by dnabarcoder) are shown on the x-axis. Coloured bars show the proportion of reads belonging to the fungal taxa within an OTU. Minimum OTU sizes of 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 were tested and shown in plots arranged from left to right. The low-abundance fungal taxa are Trichomanascus ciferri, Erysiphe necator, Eutypa lata, Penicillium chrysogenum and Candida zeylanoides which had abundances of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 reads respectively. The remaining 50 taxa in the mock community each had an abundance of 2,000 reads. The dotted line indicates the minimum OTU size relative to the OTU size.\n\n\n\nWe observed that when increasing the min_cluster_size parameter for HDBSCAN (the clustering algorithm used by NanoCLUST), reads from ‘low-abundance’ fungal taxa were placed in OTUs with unrelated taxa. For example in Figure 11, when setting the min_cluster_size to 100 reads, we see that reads from Eutypa lata were clustered together into an OTU which was classified as the distantly related Dipodascus capitatus. This behaviour was consistent when the min_cluster_size parameter exceeded the abundance of a fungal taxon. \nFor VSEARCH, the effect of a minimum OTU size was predictable in removing low-abundance OTUs. Low-abundance taxa such as Trichomanascus ciferri and Erysiphe necator were lost at lower minimum OTU sizes than expected because they had been split into smaller OTUs.",

    "text": "2 Real world - Soil case study\nFor our ‘real world’ soil study, 23 samples were taken from soil beneath six tree species and two controls were sequenced with ONT MinION 10.4.1 and gave a total of 4,365,488 reads after basecalling. After demultiplexing with minibar using a custom barcoding scheme, 3,041,450 reads remained (30% loss). Of the reads where demultiplexing failed, 88,599 reads had multiple barcode matches and 1,235,439 had unidentifiable barcodes.\n\n2.1 Quality control\nWe observed considerably higher read quality scores from the soil samples (median: Q24.0) compared to the pure fungal taxa (median: Q16.8) used in the mock scenarios (compare Figure 12 and Figure 3).  This was expected, as the soil samples were sequenced with the latest MinION chemistry and basecalled with the dorado’s latest basecalling model (v5.0.0), while the pure fungal taxa were limited to older basecalling models (v4.1.0).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Read quality of real world soil samples. Mean read quality of reads from 23 soil samples and two control samples are shown before trimming or filtering steps. The raw reads have been produced by a MinION R10.4.1 flow cell after basecalling with dorado v0.7.1 (super-high accuracy model). Quality scores are in the Phred (Q) scale. Read lengths are shown in thousands of basepairs. Histograms on X and Y axes indicate the density of reads at respective quality scores and read lengths. (Plot generated by NanoPlot (De Coster and Rademakers, 2023))\n\n\n\nAfter tracking the number of reads through the primer trimming, ITS extraction, quality filtering and chimera detection stages of the workflow, we observed a mean read loss across all samples of 14.85%, 15.56%, 12.26% and 0% respectively (Figure 13). We observed considerably more reads being retained after the primer trimming step for the soil samples as compared to the mock fungal samples (14.85% loss vs. 32.37% loss), which is likely due to the higher read quality but also due to the demultiplexing approach having already detected and filtered reads that did not match the amplicon primers. We also noted that the extraction kit (ExCon) and PCR negative control had a relatively low number of reads as expected after these stages. The sample AP6 was excluded from further processing due to having a significantly lower read count (1,173) compared to the other samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Read loss in soil case study in filtering and trimming stages. Each point represents a soil or control sample. The blue horizontal bar with percentages indicate the mean proportion of reads lost from the previous step. Four samples with relatively low read count after quality control stages have been given colours; red: AP6 (Allocasuarina paradoxa), brown: EC1 (Eucalyptus cephalocarpa), green: ExCon (extraction kit control) and pink: PCRNegCon (PCR negative control). Each step was executed in order from left to right. Note the y-axis has been plotted on a square root scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Clustering and taxonomic assignment\nThe full set of quality filtered reads were clustered with VSEARCH at 97% identity and the most abundant sequence of each OTU was classified using dnabarcoder and the UNITE+INSD 2024 database. Low-abundance OTUs were removed from samples if they were smaller than 0.15% of the number of reads in the sample. The top 30 largest OTUS can be seen in Table A8. A high proportion of OTUs could not be given a classification by dnabarcoder. 71.7% of 1,590,965 reads were considered unclassified at the kingdom level consisting of 451 out of 775 OTUs (Figure 14).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: The proportion of kingdom-level classifications in real world soil samples. Each bar represents the number of reads in each sample that are either classified to kingdom level (blue) or not (red).\n\n\n\nThe classifications by tree species are shown in Figure 16 and Figure 18 and show a higher proportion of fungi are classified in Eucalyptus species compared to Allocasuarina.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. litteralis\n\n\n\nA. paradoxa\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Classifications from Allocasuarina samples.

    "text": "1 Quality control\nAs expected from ONT sequencing, the reads used to construct our mock scenarios had considerably higher error rates than those produced by other sequencing platforms such as Illumina and PacBio (Anslan et al., 2018; Tedersoo et al., 2021, 2018). With a mean read quality of Q13.2, our approach to quality control aimed to significantly decrease noise by setting stringent quality thresholds. Setting a minimum quality score of Q20 and requiring both forward and reverse primers to be present on reads resulted in the removal of 85% of the dataset (Figure 2). If applied generally in real world scenarios, this QC approach may be overly conservative and bias against some taxa. Therefore, we aim to make these quality filtering settings configurable in the workflow so end-users can determine their own acceptable level of error. It should be noted that the sequences for the mock dataset were generated in 2022 and were not compatible with dorado’s latest basecalling model (v5.0.0 at the time of writing). We observed that using modern ONT chemistry and the latest basecalling model for our soil samples resulted in many more sequences being retained (40% loss versus the 85% loss in the mock scenarios).",

    "section": "2 Clustering",
    "text": "2 Clustering\nWe have demonstrated that clustering with VSEARCH and with our NanoCLUST implementation produced comparable results and both were able to successfully delineate major taxa in our mock scenarios. The NanoCLUST implementation was generally more sensitive to biological variation than VSEARCH in some fungal groups as it split single taxa into multiple OTUs (for example: Pucciniales (Figure 6), Cryptococcus (Figure 8) and Sclerotiniaceae (Figure 9)). The splitting of taxa in NanoCLUST may suggest the presence of ITS haplotype variants in these fungal groups. This interpretation should be treated with caution as the UMAP dimension reduction technique cannot guarantee the preservation of all structure in the lower dimensional space (Mittal et al., 2024; Asnicar et al., 2024). Closer analysis of the sequences found in each OTU may give further insight into the true source of this variation. We anticipate that by increasing the clustering identity used by VSEARCH, these taxa would also be split into multiple OTUs, although this was not tested.\nThe metrics we used to measure species recovery (i.e. number of OTUs, number of species and percentage of reads lost) gave insight into broad patterns of clustering, but had limitations when comparing clustering methods. We found that the number of OTUs was a good initial measure for comparing clustering methods as it was relatively efficient to compute. However, after performing taxonomic assignments, we found that the number of OTUs tended to overestimate the number of species present because many OTUs shared the same species-level classifications (Figure 5).\nWhen comparing the effect of a minimum OTU size on our clustering methods, we observed predictable trends in the number of OTUs that VSEARCH produced for all library sizes (Figure 4). Our NanoCLUST implementation showed less stability than VSEARCH in the number of OTUs it produced at high library sizes. Care should be taken when interpreting this comparison as the minimum OTU size filtering is not applied in the same way between clustering methods. For VSEARCH, the minimum OTU size cutoff is applied after clustering on a fixed set of OTUs. In our NanoCLUST implementation, HDBSCAN recomputed the set of OTUs for each min_cluster_size value and is therefore more dynamic than VSEARCH.\nWe found that interpreting the percentage of reads lost as a measure of the success was misleading. Our NanoCLUST implementation often lost fewer reads than VSEARCH but clustered unrelated taxa together as the minimum OTU size cutoff increased (Figure 4 and Figure 11). The HDBSCAN algorithm had the unexpected behaviour of merging small clusters together as the min_cluster_size parameter increased (Leland McInnes et al., 2016). The original NanoCLUST pipeline (Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2021) was designed for more conserved 16S regions in Bacteria, parameters validated against 16S data may not be suitable for variable ITS regions in fungi without further testing.\nOur NanoCLUST implementation was unsuitable for clustering large datasets due to computational limitations. In our case, attempting to cluster 1.8 million reads from our soil dataset with UMAP and HDBSCAN resulted in much higher memory use than was possible with a limit of 128GB RAM. By default, the NanoCLUST pipeline (Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2021) on which we modelled our implementation, only selects 100K reads from the given dataset and is expected to use between 32GB-36GB of RAM (ITER, 2024). Despite these limitations, NanoCLUST is a complex and dynamic clustering approach that shows promise for clustering variable ITS sequences. While VSEARCH uses a fixed similarity metric which is much easier to understand, with further work, NanoCLUST may be suited to cluster fungal groups with differing rates of variability at the ITS locus.",

    "text": "3 Taxonomic assignments\nIn our mock communities, in the best cases we observed a genera-level classification rate of ~95% and genera-level precision of 82% to 85%. This demonstrated that in a controlled scenario, a significant proportion of the major taxa were correctly identified. However, there were a number of major taxa that were consistently misidentified regardless of clustering approach (Table 1).\n\n\n\nTable 1: Top 10 misidentified OTUs in an even-abundance scenario (2,000 reads per taxa) using NanoCLUST. These misidentifications were also common across VSEARCH trials. The columns show: the OTU which the taxon was clustered, the barcode identifying the taxon at time of sequencing, the taxon’s ‘known’ species-level identification, the number of reads from the taxon in the OTU, the classification given by dnabarcoder, the BLAST identity score against the reference sequence, and the similarity cutoff used by dnabarcoder to classify at the species level.\n\n\n\n\notubarcodeactual speciesn readsdnabarcoder classificationscorecutoff136barcode72Pichia kudriavzevii1,996Komagataella pastoris100.00%99.10%85barcode83Diaporthe sp CCL0671,996Gnomoniopsis paraclavulata100.00%99.60%85barcode87Asteroma sp CCL0681,995Gnomoniopsis paraclavulata100.00%99.60%1barcode43Aspergillus fumigatus1,920Inopinatum lactosum100.00%99.10%20barcode65Geotrichum candidum1,675Dipodascus capitatus90.50%89.60%109barcode88Asteroma sp CCL0601,620Diaporthe foeniculina100.00%99.10%11barcode66Kluyveromyces lactis1,579Candida albicans100.00%97.30%119barcode61Cryptococcus neoformans1,169Kluyveromyces marxianus100.00%99.10%183barcode60Cryptococcus gattii703Candida orthopsilosis99.76%97.30%43barcode88Asteroma sp CCL060211Diaporthe foeniculina99.59%99.10%\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we cannot be certain of the cause of these misclassifications, we hypothesise that some may be explained by cross-sample contamination and mislabelling. Some misclassified reads had high matching BLAST scores for other taxa that were present in the mock community which may indicate that contamination has occurred. For example: reads from Kluyveromyces lactis, Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii had high scoring classifications for Candida albicans, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Candida orthopsilosis respectively. There was also a potential mislabelling of samples where Diaporthe sp CCL067 and Asteroma sp CCL060 were swapped. There were two Asteroma species in the mock community and we expected them to cluster together. Instead, Asteroma sp CCL068 and Diaporthe sp CCL067 were consistently placed in the same OTU. In addition, the major OTU in the Asteroma sp CCL060 sample was classified as Diaporthe foeniculina with 100% identity (Table 1). Despite these observations, the mislabelling is unclear because Asteroma and Diaporthe are both in Diaporthales order, so we expect considerable similarity between ITS sequences.\nThe inconsistency of taxonomic nomenclature was a significant limitation of assessing correct taxonomic assignments in an automated way. The taxa examined in this study had many taxonomic synonyms, complicating the validation process. A simple approach that only considers the taxonomic labels as-is can lead to false negatives. Our approach involved the manual (and non-exhaustive) validation of nomenclature for mock community taxa which would not scale well for larger mock communities.\nWhen assessing the precision of taxonomic classifications from our scenarios, surprisingly, we found that the highest rates of classification with the most correct classifications occurred with minimal OTU filtering for both NanoCLUST and VSEARCH (Figure 10). This went against our expectations that low-abundance OTUs were mostly erroneous and would reduce classification accuracy. We expect that these small OTUs were the result of sequencing errors but still contain sequences with a high level of similarity to the ‘correct’ reference database entry. Further investigation for patterns in these low-abundance OTUs may be fruitful for separating signal from noise.\nWhen comparing the classification accuracy of most abundant sequences versus consensus sequences, we found that most abundant sequences gave less variable results (Figure 10). We expected the consensus sequence approach used by NanoCLUST to significantly improve classification precision by correcting sequencing errors. However, we expect that there was considerable biological variation present within OTUs which introduced noise into the resulting consensus sequence. This issue was exacerbated when computing consensus sequences for OTUs clustered by VSEARCH at 97% identity as only up to 35% of reads were given classifications. As the NanoCLUST pipeline was originally intended for more conserved 16S sequences, the consensus approach may need significant adjustment for highly variable ITS sequences. If we were to refine the consensus sequence construction, it would be important to determine whether the source of errors in the resulting sequence was due to a specific polishing tool (such as racon or medaka) or due to variation in the OTUs.\n\nThe real world soil case study displayed remarkably different patterns in taxonomic assignments than in our mock scenarios. 58% of the 775 OTUs recovered in the soil case study were unidentified at the kingdom level using dnabarcoder. Many of these were in the top 30 most abundant OTUs and had between 40% to 93.75% identity to their closest matches in the UNITE+INSD database (Table A8). The class level is the highest taxonomic rank that dnabarcoder can assign with the published pre-computed ITS cutoffs (Vu et al., 2022). If dnabarcoder cannot classify a sequence to class level, it will remain unidentified at the phylum and kingdom levels. The classes Basidiomycota and Ascomycota require a similarity of 94.2% and 93.4% respectively, leaving many of our OTUs unclassified.  We expect that the dynamic cutoff approach taken by dnabarcoder makes fewer but more precise classifications. As much research focus has been on fungal communities found in the northern hemisphere, Australian fungi are often underrepresented in DNA reference databases (Johnston et al., 2024). We suspect lack of representation in the UNITE database and dnabarcoder’s conservative classification approach is the reason for the low classification rate. However, we still have detected a number of Basidiomycota, Ascomycota and Mortierellaceae across the four tree species allowing for an initial comparative analysis (Figure 16, Figure 18).\nImproved classification rate may be possible by taking advantage of highly-conserved regions found within the amplicons. The amplicons from the soil case study include the partial LSU region which may useful to assign higher taxonomic levels for OTUs that cannot be identified with the full ITS region alone. This approach may also enable phylogenetic methods and leverage existing approaches taken for studying arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Delavaux et al., 2021; Větrovský et al., 2023). The EUKARYOME reference databases (Tedersoo et al., 2024) would be a useful additional resource which contains curated sequences for SSU, ITS and LSU markers for all eukaryotes.",

    "text": "4 Recommendations\nIn determining the smallest library size required for reliably detecting taxa, in our even-abundance mock scenarios, we found that 10,000 reads across 58 taxa (167 reads per taxon) worked well for recovering species present with minimal OTU filtering (Figure 5). Higher sampling rates resulted in more misidentified and unclassified OTUS and benefited from more aggressive filtering. Although if using our NanoCLUST implementation to cluster reads, we would not recommend high values of the min_cluster_size parameter due to merging of unrelated taxa as discussed above and shown in Figure 11. If focusing on detecting rare OTUs, we suggest using minimal OTU filtering. In our uneven mock community, we were able to recover a taxon with 5 reads in a library with ~100K reads with minimum OTU sizes of 2 and 5. While low abundance taxa are recovered there is a drawback of overestimating diversity and a higher rate of false positives.\nA minimum mean quality score of Q20 was used for our analyses but as demonstrated, ONT basecalling accuracy is improving. With the latest ONT technology and the ability to generate millions of reads, it may be beneficial to increase this quality cutoff in future trials.\n\n\n\n\nAnslan,S. et al.

    "text": "We have demonstrated that ONT sequencing has emerged as a promising approach for fungal metabarcoding. Our workflow was capable of detecting major taxa in mock communities. However, while our approach was capable of detecting rare OTUs, it became difficult to differentiate true rare OTUs from false positives. We have made our workflow available publicly available for use by others (https://github.com/aringeri/nanoporcini). We confirmed existing difficulties with classifying underrepresented Australian fungal taxa in the UNITE+INSD database. However, we feel that this presents an opportunity for long-read technology in future work by classifying more conserved regions such as the 28S (LSU) marker. The quality of sequences produced by ONT sequencing has improved steadily over the past two years, if this trend continues we expect the widespread adoption of this technology to continue and become commonplace among mycologists and microbial ecologists.",
